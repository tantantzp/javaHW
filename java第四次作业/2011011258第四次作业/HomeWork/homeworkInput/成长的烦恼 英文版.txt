 Jason: Alright lady drop that spatula or you're scrambled. Maggie: Go ahead, make my day. Well, I guess I showed you. Jason: Show me more Maggie: Oh Jason, the kids. Jason: I can kiss the kids later. You know I read an article that said that two career couples should really make a special effort to always remain...frisky. Maggie: At breakfast? Jason: At all meals. Mike: What's the matter? You guys aren't gettin' enough? Jason: Michael, alot of kids would get smacked for a remark like that Mike: Come on dad, you can't hit me you're a liberal humanist. Jason: Could be an accident. Carol: Could be a dream come true. Mike: Mom, can't we sell Carol and get a tape deck for the Volvo? Carol: Mike, you give new meaning to the word vacuous. Mike: Oh yeah? What was the old meaning? Carol: I rest my case. Jason: Ben! Ben! What's so funny Ben? Ben: That Phyllis George, she's screwed up again. Maggie: Hey, what's that you're reading about? Carol: Well it says here that as the universe expands, all matter is degenerating into a state of total disorganisation. Maggie: Thank god I thought it was just me. Mike: So what are you guys doing tonight? "The House of Sweat", yeah great! Hey look can I talk to you guys later, yeah, bye. Maggie: Mike, what is "The House of Sweat"? Carol: It's that new under twenty dance club on Geravo Turnpike. Mike: Yeah, and it sounds like a great idea mom. It's a safe, wholesome place for teens to 

congregate. Maggie: And the larger the group, the smaller their brains get. Jason: Oh come on Maggie! Mike: Yeah, come on Maggie! Yes well time to go wait for that school bus; you know if I hurry I can still get a seat in the non-smoking section. Maggie: Good day! Bye sweetheart. Bye Ben, love you! Jason: Catch you later Ben! I still have some paper work to do before my nine o' clock gets here, and if you start feeling frisky and you have eight of ten seconds before work, you know where to find me. 

Jason: Good visit Waller, and hey don't worry too much about this thing, ok? See you next week. Bye bye! Mike: Can I talk with you for a second dad? Jason: Sure. Mike: In your office. Kids! Jason: So, you wanted to talk about something... Mike: Yeah, erm, mostly I just wanted to mention how smoothly things have been running, since the wife went back to work, and you moved your practice back into the house. 

Jason: Well thankyou. Mike: Dad, we've been friends now for a long time...right? Jason: Off and on, yes Mike: I know, I love that. See dad, you know that dance hall place I mentioned this morning... Jason: "The House of Sweat". Mike: Yeah, yeah. Jerry and I were talking and we decided... Jason: Jerry? Mike: Yeah, Jerry Delish. He's an older friend of mine, an excellent driver, with two years of drivers A. Jason: Two years of drivers A? 
Jason: You're workin' a fine line here Mike. Ok look, here's the deal. I'll give you a little more freedom, you've got to promise me alot more responsibility. Mike: Hey, no problem dad. I swear, I am ready for total responsibility Jason: Mike, I'm not ready for total responsibility. 

Mike: You're right, sorry. Jason: Ok? You go out and have a good time. Just remember what we talked about. Mike: Absolutely dad, thanks, I promise. Wait, what about mom, what if she's mad? Jason: Mike, your mom's not an ogre...I'll talk to her she'll understand 
Maggie: You let him do what? Jason: Maggie, he's fifteen years old now. Maggie: So what! He's fifteen! It's completely arbitrary to just pick an age like that, and say 


that is when a kid is mature. Jason: You know that by the time Mozart was fifteen, he'd written seven symphonies. Maggie: That's because Mozart's father didn't let him go to "The House of Sweat". Who did he go with? Jason: I don't know. Some kid...Jerry Dolish, Dellish. Maggie: Jerry "dog killer" Dellish. Jason: Maggie, he hit one dog. Maggie: Yeah, but he hit it four times Jason: Ok, well, err, Mike isn't Jerry, and a kid needs some freedom in order to learn responsibility. 
Jason: Well I slipped some sleeping pills into their Gatorine. They'll be asleep for about three weeks. Maggie: Jason! Jason: Well I didn't really, but they are fffrrrr, and we can frrefderrtt!!!! Hello. Yeah this is 

Jason Seaver. No you must be looking for someone else because....take your clothes off...no, no, our Mike is only fifteen, so he wouldn't be driving a car..I see. Maggie: What did he say? Jason: He said, that's why your Mike is in our jail. 
prisoner: What are you in for kid? Mike: I killed a man, just to watch him die. You? prisoner: Unpaid parking tickets. 


Mike: Oh no it's my mom! Jason: Come on Maggie, we don't even know the facts yet. I mean it's not so unusual for a teenage boy to have a minor run-in with the police. Some of these guys can be real macho headbangers. policeman: Hiya! You folks care for some hot cocoa? I just made a fresh pot. Jason: look, we're the Seavers. You've locked up our son. An officer claimed he was driving a car. policeman: Ah yes sir, we...er...picked him up in the "House of Sweat" parking lot. He was driving in circles for approximately twelve minutes. 

Jason: Maggie, don't patronize me!! Ok?! And where the hell are my pyjamas? Maggie: Gee I'm sorry I'm really not sure. Jason: Well you wouldn't think it would be so damned tough to keep tabs on a pair of pyjamas around here!!!! Maggie: Jason, I don't understand why you're so upset. I mean it's not like this is the first time he's screwed up. Jason: Who's screwed up? Maggie: Mike. 


Jason: Who said anything about Mike. I'm upset because I can't find my pyjamas. I mean if you'd left a pair of pyjamas around...and these are big pyjamas I'm talking about...and they just vanished into thin air...well wouldn't you be pretty upset???!!!!! Maggie: Absolutely. In fact I'm amazed at the way you're holding it together. 
Mike: What? Carol: I...I've never seen dad, actually too mad to talk. Mike: Well thanks for your support, you know I feel like a new man now. Carol: I'm sorry. Look it's not so bad, I bet in a year he'll look back on this whole thing and laugh. Ok, maybe chuckle. 
Jason: Ok, I admit it...I'm upset with Mike. Maggie: Oh? Jason: Aren't you? 
Jason: Uh-uh. Mike: Oh, still angry? Hey dad, I know this is no excuse, but Jerry's car handles really badly. And I was the one who decided that Jerry was too drunk to drive. 

Jason: Mike he was unconscious. Mike: I know. Jason: and what are you doing with a kid who drinks like that? Mike: I should have called you. Jason: Why didn't you? Mike: Well dad there were these girls there... Jason: Ah course! wouldn't want them to think you had parents. Mike what kind of relationship are we gonna have if I can't trust you? 


Mike: I guess I'm just a jerk, maybe you shouldn't trust me. Jason: Well that's certainly one way to go. That's the way my father went with me. I guess I hoped that when I had a son it would be different. Mike: I know dad. Jason: Mike you probably don't remember this but, when you were three weeks old, I took you to the Mets home opener, cradled you in my arms...up comes Don Clendenin...hits a shot of the left field score board to win in the twelfth. I hugged you real tight, jumped you up and down, and you, you threw up in your complimentary Mets batting container. Mike: I'm sorry dad. 

Jason: Will you stop saying that! Mike: Does mom know about this? Jason: You kidding? How do you think we met? Mike: Alright dad! Hey dad you ever get the urge to do dumb stuff now? Jason: No. No, no I don't Mike. I think that's what being an adult is all about. Mike: Oh. Alright, good night dad. Jason: Night son. Hey! Come back in here for a second. 


Maggie: (singing) I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumbling down, a tumbling down. I feel my heart start to tremble whenever you're around...ooohh baby when I see your face. 
ben, carol and Mike: (singing) Blue river, wider than the.....

18. Mike: No. Jerry was sure he’d be able to get those tickets from his friend Chichi, but... 

19. Maggie: Chichi? Jason, our son knows people named Chichi? 

20. Jason: Maggie, we cannot judge somebody’s on the base of a name. Anyway, Mike you will say. 

21. Mike: Yes, Chichi’s parole officer didn't think it would be such a good idea for him to scout tickets so close to the trial. 

22. Jason: Good judgments there Chichi. 

23. Maggie: We are sorry, honey.

your father, it doesn’t mean that there’s anything weird or uncool about it? You guys breath a word of this to anybody and you’re dead meat. 
138. Reporter: One fascinating aspect of tonight’s crowd is its broad age range, and if I am not mistaken, evidence of this cross generation appeal is right here. Excuse me, young man, did you attend this evening’s concert with your father? 

139. Mike: Who wants to know? 

140. Reporter:. All of the Tri-state area. This is the news line, New York. Sir, is this your son?

148. Carol: Really?

166. Mike: Hey, Boner. You're a real funny guy. 

167. Eddie: Hey, Mike. Listen, maybe you and your Dad could double with me and my Dad some night. Mike, you can tell us. 

168. Boner: Did you get lucky or was that goodnight kiss all you got? 

169. Carol: You guys are a lot funnier since your labotomeys. 

170. Eddie: Wow, what a family! A guy dates his dad and gets his little sister to stick up for him. This could make the news too. What a guy, we’re buddies! I love this guy. 

171. Carol: Come on Ben. I need your help. The mice need your help. 

172. Ben: I’m just not political.

176. Ben: Save the mice. 

177. C&B: Release the rodents.

195. Jason: You know I paid a lot of money for those tickets and that was so you could go to the concert. I think you’re being a little self-absorbed about this. 

196. Mike: I'm being self-absorbed? Dad. You gave me noogies on the Evening News. 

197. Jason: Well some people's parents' lock them in a closet for seven years. You got it real rough. Your father likes you. Yeah, grosse. quooties. I was showing my feelings for you, Mike. 

198. Mike: You have feelings for Mom too. You don’t go showing them infront of the whole tri-state area. Dad, you just don't know I mean the guys in school. 

199. Jason: Come on, Mike. What do you care what those guys say. 

200. Mike: It is easy for you to say. You just don't know what's it like. I mean they laughed at

me cause I went with you. But I defended you. I said my dad's a cool guy. And then what do you do? You slobbered all over me on the News Line New York. 
201. Jason: Alright, ok. Mike, I am sorry. Maybe we shouldn't have gone to the concert together. 

202. Mike: It's not what I am saying. 

203. Jason: Maybe you should've taken a girl. 

204. Mike: Dad, you’re not listening to me. Look, I’m taking a big risk by telling you this, but I actually like doing stuff with you. I do, I mean. I was sitting there and watching Springsteen with my Dad, and a lot of other people's parents don't even know what Springsteen is. And all 


through the concert I was thinking. Hey, you know this is really great, yeah. 205. Jason: Well, you know I was thinking pretty much the same thing. 206. Mike: Maybe that the way we can both think that, without letting the entire free world, in on it. 207. Jason: Well, I guess I did lose control a little? Ok, a lot. 208. Mike: That's all right, Dad. I guess Bruce does have that affect on people. I guess maybe next time we should see someone a little less dynamic. 209. Jason: Well I hear the Osmonds are coming to town. 210. Mike: Yeah, I love this guy. 211. Mike: Guys I’m telling you it does not compare with seeing him live 212. Jason: Mike, Mike, your mother and I are in the next room we’re trying to read.

What did you do today?Mike: Well, I went …Jason: Nothing! They’re children. They have boring uneventful lives. How was your day? Tell us about that story. Maggie:
 I’m sorry our lunch got turned into a work session. 
Jason:You’re kidding. That was great for me. That was shocking for me to discover how little I knew about sludge. What about the East Town dump? Maggie: Oh, honey! I am really bushed. I’d rather not even think about that stuff for a while. Ok?Jason: Ok! Sure! Mike: Oh, Dad. Don’t forget to tell her Fred just called. 
tomorrow if it means working through the night. Oh, I just cannot wait to nail those creeps.

Oh remember Fred and I will probably be working late again late tonight.Jason: So, what time you think you'll be home?Maggie: Well, it’s hard to …Jason: To estimate!Maggie: Oh, I don’t know. Between 9 and 11. Might say. Jason: You call that an estimate? No an estimate is 9:05 9:06. Maggie: Ok. Let’s say between 10 and 10:15?Jason: Well which one? 10 or 10:15?Maggie: I don’t know Jason. It’s only 15 minutes.
Jason: But that’s not probably about it, Meg. Analysing people’s motivation is what I do for a living. I’m not sexually jealous. I have far too much faith in you to ever be sexually jealous. And I would appreciate it if you had the same faith of me.Maggie: I’m sorry, Jason. I was just kidding. Forgive me?Jason: Well, ok!

Maggie: Ok? I’ll see you later! Good Jason: So what time you think you'll be home?

Jason: I can't do tadpoles again. They keep these things on file. Jason: No, I mean your mother. We should be asking your mother what to do. I think I'll go down to that newspaper office right now and ask her. Mike: Dad, why don’t you just call her? Jason: Obviously you haven't seen the PHONES they have down there. Believe me it will be a lot simpler in this way. Carol: Won't that be bothering her, dad? Jason: Absolutely not. No, no, your mother wants to be involved in these decision. Besides, I

The janitor? Maggie: No one who cleans for a living would press his nose against glass. Fred: Bet it's one of those goons from the East Town dump site. Maggie: Oh, I'll call the police. Jason: Wuuh! Fred: Jason! Maggie: Jason? Fred: You are all right? Maggie: Oh! Honey? Fred: I'm sorry. Maggie: Sit down.

Maggie: Yes, you know, and at first, I couldn't figure that out, and then it dawned on me: I AM a woman! Jason: So you admit it? You're into this Maggie. You enjoy it. Maggie: Yes, I enjoy it. People find me interesting that makes me feel good. What's wrong with that? Jason: Oh, What's wrong with it is that you're putting your husband through a living hell. And Maggie, I would never do that to you! Maggie: Ah! Jason: What do you mean "Ah"? 

Jason: I hope so. Suddenly I feel very silly. Maggie: "silly" is a strong word. Not entirely inappropriate, but strong. Jason, I love you, I could never cheat on you. Jason: Yeah. Maggie:Yeah. Jason: Well, thank you. Maggie: You are welcome...caterpillars! Jason: What?

But I'll never find out unless I leap into the darkness and give it my all Mike: If she sings "I gotta be me", I swear I'll throw up. Ben: That's two. Carol: Mom, do you think you can read my article tonight and tell me what you think?Maggie: Well, I'll be happy to, honey. Carol: You'll be honest? Maggie: Savagely honest.

Mike: That kid's going to be good. Jason: Carol's paper can't be that bad. Maggie: She wrote about guys who dig for clams.Jason: Well, what's wrong was that? Maggie: She called it "I clam, therefore I am". Jason: Did she? Maggie: Listen to this. Night obduces the ismus beneath its osydium mantel The mollusks imbibe one last sip, betwixed their valves and expel the days――muculance. Jason: she could be pushing a little? Maggie: Jason, read this. 

Jason: I am saying that we should have had pigeons, they are easier to raise. Maggie: Jason, come on. Jason: You just start off by pointing out thestrengths of the article. And then you show her how the article could be improved. Maggie: You're right. Accentuate the positive. Jason: Yes. Be gentle, nurturing and supportive. And if that doesn't work, you simply tie her the bad and set her rebboks on fire.

I read the article again, I think I can be more objective now. Maggie: That's a good thing to do. Put it away for a while, get some distance, often what you thought of it was a bit ... Carol: I know, I know... I’ve already changed it. Maggie: You did? Carol: Yeah. Maggie: Ah... 

Maggie: But...it is just not newspaper writing, honey. Look, in any field there're rules, you just have to learn them. Newspaper writing has to be more simple, straight forward. Carol: So you think my article is garbage. Maggie: Sweetheart, if I let you turn this in to Mr Simmonds, he'd tell you the same things, only meaner.Carol: “Introduction to Journalism”.

That's wonderful! Carol got the job on the paper! Carol: I turned it down!Maggie: May I come in?Carol: Sure! Maggie: What are you doing? Carol: Cleaning this garbage out of my way. Maggie: Carol, how come you turned the job down? I mean it really seemed like you had your heart set on it. Carol: Yeah! Well that was before I realised that there's nothing really creative about journalism. I mean all you do is regurgitate facts. If I’m going to be a writer I'd rather do a novel. At least people don't train their puppies on Moby Dick! Carol: I can understand you being angry at me for my criticism of your article.Carol: Why should I be angry? Simmonds gave me the job! Maggie: I know! I know. I guess, what I'm trying to say is, well, honey, it's always tricky giving criticism to someone you love. And I guess I just didn't do a very good 
job.Obviously Simmonds was very happy with what you did. And I’m glad that I was wrong...Carol: NO.Maggie: Pardon me? Carol: I said no. Ok? Are you happy? He said everything you said, only worse. He said my article was repeat with stinkiocity.

Everybody knows what muculance is.Carol: I’ll never be able to write like you.Maggie: Oh, hold on, hold on, honey, that’s just not true. That maybe you will be reaching a little.

There’s been an accident. Nailbitter has tripped and gone down. The horse is on the ground. In all my years at the track I've never seen anything like this! Ben: Get up! get up! Mike: Get up! Get up!

results of Mike's IQ test. maggie: Why? What did he get? jason: Now, then Maggie, you know these are highly subjective, many diagnosticians, they don't even consider these to mean....What did he get? psychologist: He got....Well let me just put this in context for you Mrs. Seaver. Now a score of a hundred is about average, a hundred and twenty is very bright, a hundred and forty is considered a genius, and a hundred and sixty is..... maggie: What did Mike get? psychologist: twenty seven. Maggie: What? This is ridiculous. I mean this is obviously a mistake. psychologist: I'm sorry Mrs. Seaver. We checked and double checked. Ant-acid? maggie: NO! jason: Twenty seven? 
jason: No Dr. Marlands, our son is not brain damaged! psychologist: Ok! Just checking. Now look. Mike's file indicates he's always had ah, how shall we say?...a problem with authority. For example, it says here that last year he placed a litter ofbabygerbils....intoMrs.O'Brian'sKleenexbox,andwhenshewenttoblowhernose…haha ha ha...the whole pack must just have....Oh look, excuse me. There's so little joy in my job, 

and he's got a lot of good stuff in here. jason: Thank you. Dr. Marlands, what are you getting at? psychologist: You see this. This is a normal test answer sheet. It's a mess...little dots are scattered randomly around the page. You see this. This is your son's answer sheet. The dots make little pictures of houses, airplanes. Look here, there's even one of a young woman's body in profile...nice figure. maggie: So you're saying, you're saying that Mike did this intentionally? psychologist: Well either that Mrs. Seaver, or he's a highly artistic imbecile.

I guess because you're older and cooler and everything, and I just figured that I was the only one who was getting hurt. I mean I am a sort of a nerd but, you're not really stupid. mike: Oh, so I guess it's just coincidence that you get all the A' s and I get all the C's. carol: Look!

I mean it takes brains and hard work to be as obnoxious as you are! mike: Yeah. I guess it does.

I might just go with something more traditional. You know like: Ho Ho Ho, boy do I have gifts for you. Mr. Bodewell: You have obviously worked with children. Jason: Come on Walter. You'll be fine. Mr. Bodewell: Oh Doc, I don't even know if I brought the right gifts. 

Ben: I'm getting pretty sick of this particular folk hero. Jason: I wouldn't say that too loudly. Maggie: Bye guys. Mike: Bye. Have fun! Ben: Mike Carol. Carol Mike.

Jason: Ok, don't worry. I'll stay right here. I just want to talk to you. Mr. Bodewell: Well I don't want to talk. I want to die. Jason: Walter, your problems are temporary. Death is permanent. You jump and there is no second chance. Walter what are you doing? Mr. Bodewell: I want to make sure I’m going to fit. I'll be damned if I’m going to get stuck in there. Jason: What happened this afternoon? Mr. Bodewell: The kids at the orphanage hated me. Jason: Well I find that hard to believe Walter. You played Santa to a bunch of eight year olds. Could it be that you misinterpreted the response? Mr. Bodewell: Oh you tell me. Jason: This Santa eats fruit cake. 
Jason: Walter! (falls) Walter you want to be happy. You don't want to give up like this. Mr. Bodewell: Why shouldn't I? Tell me why shouldn't I give up? I mean if I can't make it as Santa Clause with a bunch of eight year old orphans, how am I supposed to make it as Walter Bodewell. Jason: Well you work at it Walter. You chip away at each problem. You speak from the heart, 

occasionally without a prepared statement. And then when you listen back you know you start to sound just like everybody else. You're human Walter that means that occasionally you are going to have some pain and sometimes you are going to feel lonely. But if you just keep reaching out there is going to be someone there to lend you a hand.Mr. Bodewell: Thanks doc. Goodbye!Jason: Walter. Oh that's it, that's it. I see it now. It's a good idea Walter, I'm going to kill myself too! That's it. You just have a problem and you jump down the chimney Walter. Mr. Bodewell: No you can't do that.

Jason: Why not Walter? It's my chimney. Mr. Bodewell: What are you talking about? Jason: Walter! You think you're the only one with problems? Well I've got a problem too Walter, ‘cause I've got a big guy on my roof I've been counseling for four years, and he’s threatening to kill himself because I can't talk him out of it. I can't live with that on my conscience Walter. Mr. Bodewell: No!Jason: Excuse me, mind if I go first? Mr. Bodewell: No, I'm not going to let you do this. You have a wife and children. Jason: Yeah, their Christmas is pretty shot as it is. Mr. Bodewell: You are crazy. Jason: Don't try to stop me Walter. Mr. Bodewell: No Doc, I can't let you do this. Mr. Bodewell: Quit whining, it's really pathetic. Jason: It's not me. Mr. Bodewell: Well what it is? Ben: Oh, yap yap. 
Mr. Bodewell: He died. Seventeen years ago. He was the last person I ever lived with. 


Ben: Were you sad? Mr. Bodewell: Yeah.Ben: Did you cry? Mr. Bodewell: Yes. Ben: Are you still going to kill yourself? Mr. Bodewell: I don't know. Ben: Well if you don't kill yourself, you can have my puppy. ....Hello! Mr. Bodewell! Mum what happened to him?

Why would you want your sister to write you a Neo Symbolist poem? Mike: Dad, the most wonderful thing happened to me at school today. Maggie: Mike? Mike: I forgot what I was gonna say. Oh...Ok. 
(We look in Mike’s memory to his day at school) Teacher: Aaaahhhh Mike. Can you explain for us the significance of the sea, in Moby Dick? Mike: Ah, sure, sure. It's the letter between the I and the K. 

Maggie: Mike! Mike: Hey look, look. I know what you guys are thinking, but I'm just going to use this poem to get her to talk to me. Then I'll be myself. Jason: Well, if you guys think that a three Dollar poem is any substitute for real and honest communication, then go ahead. Carol: Mike, Dad's right. Real and honest is going to cost you five.

Mike: Miss Jeffers, you know how they always say, that despite all the hardships of teaching, there are those rare moments that make it all worth while. Teacher: Yes. Mike: This one's for you. "Let us go then, you and I, when the evening is spread out like a swatted fly. Life being Miasmic, somewhat protoplasmic. What does it matter, if raindrops

Mike: Ah, Mom, Dad, this is Juliette. Juliette, these are my parents. Maggie: Hello Juliette. Juliette: Mikhail’s told me so much about you. Sounds like you have a fascinating life. Ben: Yes.

Mike: But I still got to get ready. Jason: Ben! School. 

guys with a stupid letter like that. Look I try to screen these things for you guys. You know, cut down on the junk mail, protect your valuable time. It's stuck to the ceiling in the boy’s john. 
Maggie: Ben, the bus. Jason: Use it or lose it. Come on Ben. I think you're spending far too much time studying and not nearly enough horsing around.Maggie: Hey! Jason: I'm kidding. Ben knows when the old dad is kidding. Right Ben?

That's funny dad. Maggie: See he does know when his old dad is kidding.Ben: And this year I'm going to get a part. Jason: Well let’s hope, but I remember last years auditions, how heart broken you were. Ben: Come on dad! I was just a kid. 

Mike: I'll see you. Maggie: Jason!Mike: I don't know why that works, but it's really starting to burn me up. 
Carol; You now, you shouldn't judge the school by the first day. And you have to overlook all the average people. It's a public school.Scott: Well I'm used to that Carol. You'd be surprised how many average people there are in Los Angeles. My old science teacher wouldn't even let me build a small model of a thermal

I've already joined the dance decoration committee. Carol: Oh, will you be at the dance tomorrow night? Scott: Sure. Carol: Will you, um, be dancing? Scott: I haven't made up my mind yet. I might just observe.Carol: Hi Mike. Mike: Hey skunk breath. Carol: Brother. Jason: Mike, is that you? Mike: What did I do? Jason: Nothing. What do you think? Mike: It's you dad. Jason: Yeah! That's what all the patients said. Ben: Dad, dad, wait till you... Jason: Up here Ben... 
Jason: Well I hope the hours required rehearsing this part won't interfere with your studies. 


Ben: That's the best part. I can be in the play, go to all the parties, and all I have to do is lay there. Jason: My son the rock. Ben: Yeah! Mike: Now Jason, I want to talk to you about this shirt. Now is this the proper image that you wish to convey, not only for yourself, but for the family that you represent? Jason: Yeah, alright! It's a shame though. I was thinking of wearing this when your mother and I chaperone your school dance.

Mike: What? Carol: You're not really going to chaperone? Jason: Had you going there for a second, didn't I? Mike: Put it there! Carol: Yeah! Mike: Alright! Jason: Hey, wait a minute. What's this? Carol: What? Jason; for the first time in your lives, you two agree on something. That's better.Mike: I thought you said you didn't care if they chaperoned or not. Carol: Well I don't. Really. Jason: Hey Carol you don't even go to these dances. Carol: Well I might go to this one. I'm keeping my options open. 
Maggie: You see, I can’t wear this. Chaperones are supposed to look stodgy and respectable. 

Jason: Hey, why don't you wear this one?Maggie: You think that dress is stodgy? Jason: This one? Stodgy? I'm kidding. I love this dress. It's my favorite dress. I have dreams about this dress.Maggie: Ok. Oh sweetheart, I haven't had the chance to tell you how surprised and happy I was that you changed your mind and agreed to do this. It shows real maturity. Jason: Well, that's me: mature, yet curiously juvenile. Maggie: And of course the fact that Carol's going had nothing to do with it al all.

Scott: Isn't life crazy. I meet you for the first time yesterday and then I find out that we are on the same decorating committee. Carol: Crazy crazy crazy! My parents are chaperoning tonight. Scott: I'm sorry! Carol: Thank you. It came as quite a shock.Scott: I can imagine. My parents chaperoned once.Carol: How was it? Scott: It was mortifying. They, Carol, they danced. Carol: Oh my god! 
Ward: Ah yes. Mrs. Hinkley: I don't know, maybe it is alright for a guy to run a psychiatric practice out of the home, and maybe it’s alright for a woman to go back to work just when her children need her 

most. Maybe letting her offspring run wild is hunky dory, and maybe I’m just old-fashioned... Ward: Could be. Mrs. Hinkley: Ward, Ward I’m worried about the Seavers. The type of people we need for chaperoning should be able to control their own children. Ward: Wow, that's a pretty high standard.Scott: Boy! Your parents sound worse than mine.
Maggie: Hi honey1

This is great!Carol: No it's not.
Maggie: Jason, how can you stand there so calmly? Jason: Actually I have deeply rooted feelings of anger and hostility. I just refuse to give vent to them until we found out if there is some misunderstanding. 

Maggie: I'll give her a vent. Carol: This will be all over school by tomorrow. Jason: Oh Carol, it will not. How's anybody going to hear? Mike: No, I’m not kidding. That's what they said: unacceptable. Oh hold on, I have someone else on the other line. Jason: Mike this is nothing to brag about. Mike: I know dad. Hello. Hi Jerry. Oh you heard. Yeah!

And we're probably going to end up hurling obscenities at this woman and what would that accomplish? Ah what the heck, let's give it a shot.Mr. Hinkley: June bug. These birds are very close.
Ben: Uh Oh! Jason: Hey Ben. Where's your brother. Be: At the dance. Jason: Where's your sister? Ben: In her room. Maggie: Where's the coach?

Maggie: That when Mike looked you in the eye and lied, it made you question your whole approach to teaching our kids the value of truth and honesty. And you're wondering if instead of encouraging them by example, a little fear or punishment might have been a bit more effective. And you're probably remembering the time when Mike was eight and he lied about finger painting the new rug and I wanted to

Jason: Michael, 'wacko' is a term that psychiatrist reserve for members of their immediate family. Mike: Just kidding. Jason: Well don't! What you've just witnessed is a classic display of displaced anger in which I allowed my frustrations to be vented on the first available person to upset me. This transference lets me lessen my stress and allows me to feel really....stupid.

She's an editor, a woman, young, articulate, and she's a very sweet person. Susan: Maggie, about your article. Maggie: aha. susan: I just got a call from a Joseph k. chadway, the builder you accused of bribeing county officials, in the story I ran on page one this morning. Maggie: aha.

I mean that's about as basic as it gets. Maggie I am pulling you from the follow up, and getting a real reporter. Maggie: Well, was I right? Is she nice or what? mike: Uh uh. It's on. It's still on. 

Jason: What. What is it? mike: Don't you see. If Gilligan goes on without me, so does my school. You know all day today life went on, even though I wasn't there. Jason: Mike this is your first philosophical realisation. I'm proud of you. See, you can learn from T.V. mike: Dad, all day today life went on without me, and you too.

Jason: What? Maggie: It's what kept going through my head when Susan was yelling at me. Jason: What? Maggie: That instead of working, I could be home doing the laundry....and it sounded good. Jason: Oh, you weren't thinking straight. Maggie: Jason it's time I faced a few things and I need your advice. Jason: O.k. 

Jason: Well, I did yes. Maggie: Yes, and I love you for it. Jason: Thankyou. Maggie: So I know you'll be fair and objective here too, even if you really wanted me to quit, because I know that staying at home has to be getting to you. Should I quit?

Jason: This isn't the Daily Planet? Excuse me. Louis!! Clark!! Jimmy!! Maggie: Jason, what were you thinking? Jason: At which emabarrassing point?Maggie: Are you tring to get me fired? Jason: No, I came down here to keep you from quitting. Maggie: Yesterday you told me to quit. Jason: Well that was bad advice. Maggie: That I relied on. Jason: Well today I rushed down here to stop you from following it. Why didn't you follow it? 
Maggie: Because it was bad advice. Jason: O.k I admit it. I liked the idea of you coming back and taking over the house. I'vebeen feeling trapped. Maggie: And you saw Long Island General as a way out? Jason: YOu knew about that? Maggie: When I was leaving this morning I happened to find this. Reasons to take the job. Reasons to turn it down. Jason: Guess you probably read it too. Maggie: Yep. Both columns. Jason why didn't you tell me about the offer? Jason: Well, because I didn't want it to seem like I was telling you to quit so that I could pursue my opportunity...which I was. 
Maggie: Jason, it's nine to one in favour of taking the job. Jason: Yes, but the one reason not to; the one called Maggie, that's more important to me than all the rest. 
Jason: Hey well, it's only fair. You know, I guess it's my turn to stay home with Gilligan and the skipper and.... We gotta ask Mike he's the new philosopher of the family. Jason: Mr. Pearlo's feelings of paranoia have been greatly reduced, by the realisation of the fact that he is indeed universally disliked. On the bright side... carol: dad! 
Jason: In here Carol, hi honey, how was careers day? carol: Well see I realised most jobs hang by a slender thread. So I decided not to do mum'sjob, and I did Emily Sullivan's father's job instead.Jason: ahh, what does do? carol: He's a clerk at the unemployment office. mike: Hey great news dad.

Growing Pains 122 V2.0 
Jason: Maggie! What's Uncle Bob doing sleeping in my office? Maggie: Oh...He and Mike played Poker last night. Mike won his room back. Jason: Really? Well, I'm glad to see Mike getting the upper hand for a change. Maggie: Me too. Too bad he lost your car. Jason: Well maybe Uncle Bob wouldn't mind giving us a lift to the store later. Mike: Where's Uncle Bob? Maggie: Still asleep I guess. 

Maggie: For those of you that cried at the funeral, I just want to say that it's nothing to be ashamed of. Jason: Thank you Maggie. Maggie: Well! Are we all ready? Carol: This feels kind of strange Mom. Maggie: Oh it won't after we get started honey. Uncle Bob called this a "remembering session". When someone in my family passed on, Uncle Bob would lead us all in sharing fond memories of that person. Jason: Who he would lovingly refer to as "the dearly defunct".

Maggie: Who wants to start? Ok then, I will. When I was a little girl, I wanted to be a dancer. And do you know why? Ben: Why? Maggie: Because Uncle Bob took me to my very first ballet. And I remember he said, "They walk around on their toes, they do flapping things with their arms, and it doesn't make any sense, but it's pretty." Ain't it? Carol: Remember when I had my appendix out?And Uncle Bob brought one in a jar and told me not to worry, because he knew how to put it back in. Ben: Yeah! And when the nurse came, he showed her the jar, and said he got it out of the soda machine. Jason: And then he said he wanted his Quarter back. 
Ben: Yahoo! Uncle Bob: So the other fellow says, "If I can walk that way, I wouldn't nee talcum powder". 

Mike: At least you're not the kind of guy who likes to rub it in. Uncle Bob: Thanks for the help guys. Ben: Are you kidding? We live for stuff like this! Jason: Ben! Don't let them tease you son! Mike: Hey, it's alright Dad, I can take it. Jason: At a boy! Hey you want some pizza? Uncle Bob stopped for one on the way back. Uncle Bob: Come on pal! Don't take it so hard. You know you're my favourite nephew...what's your name again? Mike: Alright look! You beat me again, but I'm young and sooner or later I'm gonna come out on top.

Mike finally got the best of you at something. Uncle Bob: Oh well, not really. I took the knobs off the shower. Mike: Hey I didn't want to take a shower. Maggie: Your turn Mike. What do you remember? Mike: Deuces, Jacks, man with an axe. Pair of natural Sevens takes all. Ben: Huh? 

Mike: Oh no, it's ok really. She lets me get away with everything when it comes to you. Uncle Bob: She does? Let's go down town and get some tattoos! Ben: You got tattooed? Mike: He was just kidding! The most important thing I ever learnt from Uncle Bob, was "never draw to an inside straight". Jason: Hey! You remember that Thanksgiving when Uncle Bob the whole turkey out and he put it in front of big old Aunt Doris and he said, "you go ahead and start! Ours will be out in a minute!" 
Mike: Alright already! Look, you wake me up at three thirty in the morning. I say "no

Yeah, am I your buddy or what? (burps) You bet ya! Uncle Bob: Morning Mike! Mike: Ah it was just a dream. It didn't really happen. Oh my bed, I love you. Thank you for only making it a dream. Oh! And my pillow. I love you pillow! Carol: Breakfast's ready! Mike: I can explain all this. Carol: Don't bother Mike! We've known about you and your pillow for a long time now. Mike: She just doesn't understand. 

Maggie: I'll give you hint...it's Frankenstein. I'm going to bed. Ben: Me too! Mike: Hey wait a minute! Wait a minute! Now how about a game of Monopoly. Now there's a game that's fun for all ages. Jason: Mike! We played Monopoly, and we played Scrabble...Parcheesi, and Ball tag. I mean there's a limit to how much a family can stand in one night. Maggie: And we passed it about two hours ago. Jason: Coming Mike? Mike: No, I think I'll get on the horn and see who's around. Jason: At midnight?

Jason: Sure you don't want to talk about it for a minute. Mike: No, no, there's really nothing to talk about Dad, really. Jason: Ok! Good night. Mike: Hey Dad what happens to people when they die? Jason: This could take longer than a minute. Mike: If it takes all night, it's ok by me. 

Mike: He said "Hi Mike." Jason: Sounds pretty friendly. Mike: Dad, I don't know what to do. And I know he'll be back! Jason: Why don't you talk to him? Mike: I should just have a chat to a dead guy? Jason: Well either that, or we're gonna be playing a lot of Charades around here...and you're already out of Godzilla movies. Mike: I don't know. Jason: Well, what's to be afraid of? You act like he's a bad guy and you know he loved you. Mike: Maybe he's changed.

Jason: Well Mike, if you really believe that you've seen Uncle Bob, then you should ask him what he wants. Mike: Do you say stuff like this to your patients? Jason: Yes. Mike: And they give you money for this? Jason: Well, it doesn't matter what I believe Mike. What matters is that even if your mind played a trick on you, it did it for a reason. And the best way of discovering that reason is to ask. Mike: Uncle Bob. Jason: Or your image of him. Do you understand? Mike: Mmmm.....I couldn't just do this by mail? Jason: Yeah if you have the address. 
Mike: I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you. Uncle Bob: Not half as sorry as I am to hear it. You sure about this? Mike: Yeah, I'm positive. I went to your funeral on Friday. 

Uncle Bob: Oh!? Good funeral? Mike: Yeah! Good funeral. A lot of people came. Dad cried. Uncle Bob: Good old Jason. Hey! Hey did...did Jack Coward show up? He always said he was going to belly up before...What am I saying? What am I saying? I'm not dead, I'm alive! Oh, you had me going for a minute. Mike: I see I'm not getting my point across here. Look! Uncle Bob, what have you been doing for the last week? Uncle Bob: Well, I don't know...er...usual stuff I guess. Mike: Like what? Uncle Bob: Well...like running and...

Mike: Uncle Bob, don't you think that's a little weird to...to spend the whole week doing nothing but running? 

Mike and Uncle Bob: Very carefully. Uncle Bob: Remember the time I died in the den and you put whip cream on my face? Mike: Gee, I didn't know you were dead. Wait a minute. If you were dead, how did you know about the whipped cream? Uncle Bob: I know a lot of things I didn't know before. Mike, I'm sorry I always teased you and tried to embarrass you.Mike: Hey, It's ok. I mean humiliation builds character. Uncle Bob: There you go then. You see I'm not leaving you. I'm in your memory, I'm in your character. I'm part of you. Goodbye Mike. Mike: Goodbye Uncle Bob.

Mike: Guy alright, I’m staying. All right, and the least you could do is put off my humiliation until he's asleep. Jason: Well, this sure cuts into my fun., and how about you, Maggie? Maggie: Yes, humiliating Mike was one reason I had these movies transferred. But if he'll stop make snide comments and join in the fun by playing a little background music, just so 5 years of piano lessons don’t go down the drain. Mike: All right, look, I know this family fun is going to kill me. Carol: This is my tape.

In fact, you are so quiet it's like you are not even here. Jason, honey I was talking to you. Jason: Sorry. Maggie: I think seeing yourself that young has made you feel a little old. Jason: Old? Ha! Maggie: In fact I would guess you were in that bathroom staring in the mirror probably looking for gray hairs. Jason: well, you couldn’t be more wrong. I'm hardly the kind of guy who goes looking for gray hairs. Maggie: I’m sorry, you are right. That’s ridiculous. Of course you weren't looking for gray hairs. Jason: I’m a young man.

But trusting Mike is a real…Jason: Ah, very good. You're back to stupidity again. I’m not trusting him any more, Maggie. Maggie: Jason, I know he let us down, but maybe there is some…Jason: Oh, you know, he lied to us for a solid week just so he wouldn’t lose that car.

If you had somehow found out that I was fired, you’d be out here pacing, telling mom how stupid you were to trust me. Jason: Well, possibly we may…Mike: Dad, don’t you see, you know how hard it’s been for me to keep the truth from you? Jason: So you lied to me for me? Mike: Yeah, I just didn’t wanna let you down. No matter what happened to me it didn’t matter. Jason: Well, I appreciate that. Maggie: Michael? We’ve been waiting for you.

Jason: Yes. Is that a great kid or what? 
Jason: So there’s a difference between doing the wrong thing for the wrong reason, and the wrong thing for the right reason. Any questions? All: No, no, no. Jason: Ok.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com (In school reading a play) Carol: "Oh swear not by by the moon, the inconstant moon, that monthly changes in her circled orb, lest that thy love prove likewise, variable." Pupil: "What shall I swear by?" Teacher: Hey! We're trying to do a little "Romeo and Juliet" here! We don't need no insensitive jerk, messing it up. Bobby: I'm sorry Coach. Teacher: Alright...err...go back to the part where Romeo was thwearing. Ok, people. Remember next week we have a major exam on all the Shakespeare Sonnets. So you better know your assonants from your elbows. Friend: Are you coming Carol, or what? Carol: Where are sensitive men, like Romeo, nowadays? Men, who aren't afraid to cry. I mean, all we have are insensitive jocks. Friend: Do you think Tom Cruise Cries? Friend 2: Tom Cruise can do anything he wants. Teacher: Seaver! Carol: Yes, Mr. Lovett. Teacher: I'm gonna say something to you that might shock you. But in this class, I consider you my equal. Well, what I mean is, if I had a question about Shakespeare, and I had a choice of either asking him or you; I'd ask you. Carol: Well thank you. Teacher: And it has nothing to do with the fact that they ran around in tights all the time. And the point is, is that I need your help. It's no big secret that I wouldn't even be teaching this class, if Mrs. Orbeaux hadn't gone a little bit flaky, if you know what I mean? But there's a kid who's flunking the class, who shouldn't be and I kind o' blame myself. So, I was wondering if, maybe you could tutor him. Carol: Well, I've never really thought of myself as a ... teacher. Teacher: Hey, who has? So what do you say?

Carol: Ok, I'll give it a shot. Teacher: Ah, yeah. Hey, Bobby! Carol: The jock? Bobby: Yo, Coach!! Teacher: Now, Bobby. Seaver here's gonna help you through all that Shakespeare stuff... Bobby: Alright. Teacher: Now, look! You do everything she says, because, if you don't pass, you don't play. And it aint gonna do you no good comin' crying your eyes out to me; like you did last year. Bobby: I don't thing we ever really met. I'm Bobby Winette. Carol: I know. Bobby: And you're Carol, "The Brain". Carol: I know. You actually cried last year? Bobby: Yeah. Groin pull.
Jason: Hello. Ben: It's not one of your mental patients, Dad, it's just me. Jason: Hey, you're home early, Ben. Ben: Yeah, my teacher got food poisoning from the "Tuna Surprise" in the cafeteria. She was surprised alright. Jason: Is she OK? Ben: I guess. Alls I know is that one minute Miss Cutter was reading off "The Little Fish That 
Mike: Hey, Dad! Ask me how school went today! Jason: I'm afraid to... Mike: It went great Dad we had this pop quiz in health class and got ... Are you ready for this?... an A!!! Jason: An A? Mike: Yeah! 
Mike: Yeah, Yeah. See, we had to list the four basic food groups, and I got every single one of 'em right. 

Jason: Wow! Mike: Those two hours of studying really paid off.Carol: Hi Dad. Jason: Hi. Carol: Mike, you're home!! Ben, you're home too!! Dad, would you make Mike take Ben some place. Jason: Any place in particular? Carol: Beijing would be good.

Mike: Look! How come all of a sudden, you don't want us around? Carol: It's not sudden. Jason: Carol! Mike: Oh, no, no, no, I get it Dad. She's probably got one of her "oh so brainy friends" coming over and she's afraid that we'll embarrass her. Which of course we will. Carol: It's none of your business, who I've got coming over. Jason: Look, Carol, being ashamed of your brothers, is not nice. Ben: Yeah. (Ben burps) Jason: Could've been worse. Which one of you guys wants to come with me to pick up your Mom? Free ice-cream. Ben: Let's roll. 
Mike: Yeah, yeah, that's what my close friends call me. 


Bobby: So, Carol, where do you wanna study? Mike: Aha. That explains why you'd be over here seeing her. Carol: Well, how about my room? There'll be fewer stupid interruptions. Bobby: Your parents won't mind? Carol: Well, we're the only ones here. Except for Mark, of course. 
Carol: Bobby, I don't know why Romeo didn't try CPR on Juliet before he killed himself. Bobby: I mean, the guy doesn't even check the pulse, before he does himself in.

Carol: Bobby, the play is over four hundred years old. It's a Classic. Bobby: Look! To you geniuses, it may make sense that Juliet gets some drug from a priest, and pretends like she's dead, so that she can run off with a guy who's too stupid to pick up the phone and call a doctor. Well, to a guy like me, it's sheep dip!! Carol: You're calling Shakespeare, "sheep dip"? Bobby: If I was Romeo, and you were Juliet and I really had it bad for you, there's nothing nobody could say that would get in the way...not my family, not your family, not nobody. By the time those people turned around to look for you and me, we'd be in my pick-up, half way to Jersey!! I'm sorry I lost my temper. Sometimes my emotions get the best of me. I guess I'm too sensitive. Carol: It's OK. I really didn't want it anymore, anyway. Bobby: This tutoring stuff's a bad idea. My head's too thick. 
Jason: Our son has a very weird sense of humour. 


Maggie: Yeah, little kill. Carol: Hi Mom, Dad, this is Bobby. Bobby: Please to meet you. Jason: The football player? Bobby: Yeah, you heard of me? Jason: Yeah, I just didn't believe it. Maggie: Carol, what's going on here? Carol: I'm tutoring Bobby.

Maggie: Oh, well that makes sense. Bobby: Yeah. Carol's translating this Shakespeare guy into English. Maggie: Well, nice to meet you Bobby. Bobby: The pleasure was distinctly mine Mrs. Seaver. Mr. Seaver. Jason: Yo. Football. Bobby: Oh, Carol, I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks again. Maggie: Nice boy. Carol: Yeah. Maggie: Certainly was polite. Carol: Yeah. Maggie: And cute. Carol: Yeah. Jason: You're doing great Maggie. Maggie: So, what do you think of him? 
Carol: He'd have to be an intellectual; at least as smart as I am, if not smarter. He'd have to sensitive and vulnerable too, with a full understanding of the universe, and our place in it. 

Jason: Well, we're safe. She's eliminated everybody but Karl Sagin. 

Teacher: "What soft white light, through yonder window breaks? It is the..." What do you want? Pupil: Can you explain what that means? Teacher: Well, it's an analogy, wherein Shakespeare likens the presence of Juliet to that of the rising sun. You chuckle head! OK, I want you to read the first act of "Much Ado About Nothing", and be prepared to talk about what all the...err..."do" is about.

Friend: Oh great, more homework. It's only Tuesday and I'm already getting behind. Friend 2: Speaking of getting behind, does anyone wanna go watch the boys' swim team practise after school? Carol: That is so dumb. Friend 2: Carol, don't you ever have any fun? Bobby: Carol, I'll see you after school at your place. Carol: OK. Friends: She does! Friend 2: So, like what is this Bobby Winette situation? Carol: There's no situation, I'm just tutoring him. Friend: Oh, well what figures. Carol: And what is that supposed to mean? Friend: Well, I don't know. 

Jason: Mike, you look like you've been in a fight! Mike: Oh yeah! Jason: Well, who with? Mike: My sixth period speech class. Jason: What, you fought the whole class?

Mike: Yeah. Look, alright. At the start of the class, everybody comes up to me and asks if I've heard the news. I say, "what news?", "about Carol". Well, you know me, I'm always ready for a good Carol nerd story. Yeah, and then he starts saying this disgusting stuff about Carol. So, I keep smiling, you see, and waiting for the punch line; only he's not kidding. And I don't know what happened but the next thing I know, I was in there punching Eddie out. And then I was in there swinging and kicking, and I couldn't even figure out why I was so angry. I'm here I was, getting all busted up, protecting Carol!! I must have been delirious. Jason: Wait a minute. But, well, what were they saying about Carol? Mike: Well, that she's been...sleeping with Bobby Winette, right up in her own room! Jason: Oh. That doesn't even make any sense. 
Carol: Exactly! Bobby: Alright! Carol: OK. Here. Bobby: "Sin from my lips, oh tre...tre...tre..." Carol: Trespass. Bobby: "...Trespass sweetly urged. Give me my sin again." So, he gets the message, right? 

Carol: Right! And then they kiss, restating their love, even though they are from two different worlds. Bobby: Carol. Carol: Yes. Bobby: You're really...smart. Carol: Lucky me. Bobby: Oh, no, I mean it's nice! I...I...I never hung out with a smart girl before; it's interesting.

Mike: Well...it's a little early Dad. Jason: Well what are your choices? Mike: Ah...Dad, Dad, you know how you...err...always said you never wanted to push me? Well, you're pushing me. Carol: Did you tell Dad about all the money you stole from us? Jason: What? Mike: Ahh, no, no Dad she doesn't know what she's talking about. Just between you and me, I'm worried about her. Ben: Did you spend all that money at the Arcade? Mike: Ben of course has several cylinders and is firing them. Jason: You were down at the Arcade playing video games?

Ben: And mine! Mike: I won it! Carol: You stole it! Ben: From a little kid too!! 
Mike: Oh please. Jason: No, Mike, I'm talking about your future here! You know that nine out of ten con-men end up spending empty bitter lives as chiropractors? Mike, I want something better for you than a life of hugging men who've thrown their backs out. 

Mike: Ok. My topic is "indecent exposure". Now, it's interesting to note, that in some places in the world, the only part of a female body that, by law, must be covered is the face. And if you've been to a Convenience store lately, you can clearly see where that law comes from! Naaa. Hey Mom, what are you doing home early? Maggie: Oh, I need an insurance form. My tooth is killing me. Ben: Look! Look what I've got! Maggie: What Ben?

Jason: Are you gonna let me handle this myself? (Mike crawls through the window) Mike: Alright!!

Mike: So then I said to myself, "Mike, you got two choices. Either you can turn your head the other way and make your curfew, or you can be a measly two hours and ten minutes late, and save a few lives. Maggie: Wow.

Mike: Oh um, right, See I make that mistake all the time. See I turned down the Yale scholarship and took the one from Harvard instead. Stacey: Oh, my little sister is freaking out. Mike: Yeah, you know. My little brother probably drove her to it. See he only recently discovered girls and uh, maybe Trudy got a little more than she bargained for.Stacey: Ah, that's sweet. Well.. Mike: Uh, you know it's very sweet and you know what really gets me is that the first crush my little brother has on a girl she has to go home early. Stacey: Oh that’s a shame. Mike: A shame. It's a crime. 
Mike: So. Ben, all women laugh at guys. You just gotta get used to it. This is no time to give up. Ben: Oh good mike. You just squished Mr. and Mrs. Jones.

Mike: look Ben. I'm going to tell you what I’m going o do. I'm going to tell you all you need to know about women, so you can go right back up there and have the last laugh on Trudy. Ok? Ben: She doesn't care. Mike: Doesn't care! Come on Ben. Don't fall for her little act. Now listen to me, all girls do and say the opposite of what they mean. And don't tell me you didn't know that.

Jason: No. We just want to know what this is all about. 


Maggie: But we are certainly not upset. Jason: We'd be upset if you were serious about this. Carol: I am. Maggie: Well then. We're upset. Carol: Mum. I've been thinking about this for a long time. And then last week, this girl in my Latin class came in after having it done, and mum she looks great. Maggie: But honey you have a cute nose.

about it. We sit her down, we talk to her and we ask her reasons. Then we have an intelligent dialogue between a responsible child and her supportive parents. Maggie: Sure. We ask her all the right questions and carol will see that she hasn't thought this thing through at all. Carol: A nose job or rhyno plasti is an out patient procedure normally involving a local anesthetic that wears off in about four hours. It is usually recommended that the patient remain in bed for one additional day. There is discoloration of the nose and orbits of the eyes as a result of haemotoma from blows to the mallet.

And this is not a whim or an adolescent phase if that's what you're thinking. Jason: Oh not me. Carol: The basic question here is, do you believe that the size of a persons nose can affect the course of their life? Jason: Well.. Carol: Explain Carl Molden? 

Jason: No point to suddenly start treating her like she's bens age. Maggie: Well she’ll get used to it. Jason: I say we should go ahead and tell her she can have the nose job. Maggie: Jason.Jason: If she pays for it herself. See that way, for every dime she has to save, she'll have time tosee if it’s worth it. Twenty four hundred dollars. That’s a lot of thinking Maggie.

Carol: Oh come on mike. I'm sorry. What job? Mike: Truly sorry? Carol: In tears. What's the job? 
Mike: Mum, can't we just eat a skeleton instead? 


Maggie: What in the world? Carol: Since I have to wait so long to save the money I need, I decided to camouflage my facial deformity, with the subtle use of make up. Mike: Looking good carol.

Carol: You know very well why I’m doing this. You are just setting me up for one of your little jokes. Mike: What jokes? Carol: Oh I don't know. Probably some stupid joke like, "carol, if you really want to improve you looks, why don't you just get a new flea collar?' Mike: That’s good. I like that Carol. Hey, you said it.

Come on ladies! Maggie Seaver you come on down!Oh, you need to get with Gracey Thornton. She's our carnival chairman. Chairperson. Yes Gracey. 
Maggie: Wait a minute. How many of you have volunteered to work on the carnival? Well with this attitude, I’m surprised somebody hasn't moved to cancel the whole carnival. 

Lady: I second that motion.Maggie: Stop it. So this means we are all too busy to help the children. Is that it? Well look. I’m busy too but I am going to make the time. What do you all have to do that's so important? The cooking? The laundry. The housekeeping.Macey: I'm arguing a case before the state supreme court.Maggie: Ok. But what about the rest of us?

I was doing my internship in phoenix and your mom had the new job at newsweek.

Jason and Maggie: "The student is not realizing full potential".

Maggie: That's the one. Anyway take him with you. Show him round the campus. Let him see what he'll be missing, if he doesn't get his act together. Jason: Maggie, that's a terrible idea. Maggie: It is? Jason: Do you know what I could do? I could take him with me to Boston and soft sell him about college. Maggie: Ah! Show him around the campus? Jason: Yes!

I could show you around my college. The place where I had some of the best years of my life. Mike: Na..I don't know Dad. I think maybe I wanna stay at the hotel and find some women. Jason: Mike.

us, we’re going to be talking through our feelings.Ben: I don’t have any feelings. I’m fine.Jason: You’re fine?Ben: I will be as soon as I change my shorts.
[Next scene] 

Jason: Ok, Mike, we’ll come back to you. Ben, what about you?Maggie: He’s sleeping. Jason, this has been very helpful and I feel much better. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some cleaning to do.
Ben: Or Mom.Jason: Alright, who else thinks there’s a possibility someone else will break in? Come on. Be honest. Maggie!Maggie: Well, you wanted honesty. See what happens when you ask for that? I was quite happy to stand here with my vacuum cleaner in line.Jason: No, I’m glad you didn’t. This is good. Well, I mean it’s good that we’re finally able to admit that the reason we can’t sleep is that we’re afraid. All of us.

Ben: You’re afraid, too?Jason: Yes, Ben.Ben: You’re a dad and everything!Mike: Dad, if you keep going on like this, this kid is going to explode.Jason: Look, I don’t mean to frighten anyone, but if we don’t deal with this honestly, Ben’s going to be dragging that box to college.Ben: It’s not heavy.Carol: Well, what should we do?

Jason: Well, that’s the question. Something terrible has just happened to us. What do we do?Mike: Dad, is this one of those questions that you always ask us that you already know the answer to?Jason: Well, I have some thoughts; I’d like to hear yours.Maggie: I say we get a burglar alarm, the biggest and loudest.Mike: Do you honestly think Sylvester Stallone has a burglar alarm?Maggie: No, his wife got that in the settlement.Mike: Look, my point is the only way to protect yourself is with guns. Lots of them!Ben: Yea!Maggie: No!Carol: That’s so stupid.Mike: You got a better idea.Carol: As a matter of fact, I do.Jason: Alright, let’s hear it.

Carol: Sure!Jason: Your hairdryer?Carol: Well, seen in the proper perspective, a hairdryer really is nothing more than concentrated wind which is free and that’s not a possession. See? It all works out!Ben: I wish I had a gun now.Maggie: Jason, it would be helpful to limit this conversation to reasonable, rational solutions.Jason: Like what?Maggie: Like putting our house up for sale and moving to a small island off the coast of Maine.

Jason: Or why not a small island off the coast of France?Maggie: We don’t speak French!Jason: Maggie!Maggie: Look, I know we can’t move, but I sure feel like going somewhere that’s secure. All I want is for my kids to feel as safe as I did when I was a little girl.Jason: Maggie, your father was a policeman. Nobody would rob a cop!Mike: Right, because everyone knows that cops have guns! Jason: Guns are not the answer, Mike! Besides, if we had a gun, that could have gotten stolen, too. And there’s a distinct possibility that somebody could get accidentally shot while sneaking in here late.Mike: That’s a point.Carol: So, we all agree. We give everything away.Jason: Right!Mike: What?
Carol: Dad, the question doesn’t make sense.

Jason: Why not?Carol: If we’re feeling safe and secure, no one can steal that.Jason: And isn’t that exactly what they…Carol: We’re letting the thieves do to us.Mike: Yea…Jason: That’s right.Ben: So what the heck are we supposed to do?Jason: We don’t let them take it, Ben.

Ben: Listen to you yell at Mike for sneaking in late. 
Jason: After that. 
Maggie: We go out to breakfast. 
Jason: Right! Come on, what do you say? 
Ben: But who’s going to watch my stuff? 
Jason: Nobody, Ben. That’s it, you see. Either you own your stuff or your stuff owns you. Mike! 
Mike: I could eat. 
Jason: Carol? 
Carol: I feel like pigs in a blanket. Shut up, Mike. 
Jason: Maggie? 
Maggie: I knew you were making a point. I was sure of it all along. I never doubted you for a 
second. 
Jason: Ok, come on. You’ve all got five minutes to change. 
Maggie: Who needs Sylvester Stallone when we’ve got Jason Roland Seaver? 
Mike: Roland? 
Jason: Come on. Get upstairs. 
Mike: Alright. 
Jason: Go ahead, Ben. 
Jason: Yea, come on, our secret.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Friend #1: Hi Carol! Carol: Hi. Friend #2: Wanna come with us to watch the basketball team workout? Carol: Why would I want to do that? Friend #1: Tall, tall guys in teeny-weeny shorts? Friend #2: Gluteus to the maximus, if you get my meaning. Carol: Uh, sorry, I can’t. I’m helping Bobby study for an English test. Friend #1 and #2: Whoop-de-do. Friend #2: Carol, when you and Bobby started going out we had great hope for you. Friend #1: Great hope! Friend #2: But your relationship has turned into something disgustingly boring. Carol: Boring, huh? Well, just because we don’t run around here like teenagers, doesn’t mean that underneath there’s not a seething river of white, hot passion. Bobby: Yo, Carol! Look, I’m sorry I’m late, but I can’t study right now. I owe Coach Lump some power squats. But I’ll study at your house after football practice, ok? Carol: Sure. Bobby: Kiss! Carol: Kiss! Friend #1: Is that sick or what? Friend #2: Carol, admit it. The river of passion has dried up like my mother’s skin.Carol: Well, it’s obvious that neither one of you have ever been involved in a mature, lasting relationship. Friend #1: Who’d want to be?Carol: So how could you possibly understand that Bobby and I are different? We’re not into that typical flirty, giggling kind of teenage fling. We’re building something lasting and good. And even if Mr. Perfect were to walk up to me right now, I’d say, ‘I’m taken.’Jeffrey: Oh, excuse me.

Carol: Uh, let me put this another way, Mom. Ok, alright, alright. Let’s say you’re out for a walk, ok? And you pass a shoe store, ok? And we’ll say the mall. Now in this shoe store you see this really hot looking pair of shoes. Now you really don’t need new shoes, I mean, your old ones are very comfortable and fine and you wouldn’t have even thought about getting a new pair except that fate brought you to this store, with this window, and these shoes…standing right there looking so sexy and right. Uh, what would you do, Mom?Maggie: What color are these shoes?Carol: Mom, color doesn’t matter.

Moonlighting?Mike: Look, Ben, this tape is for me so I can do a better audition tomorrow, alright?Ben: Ok. But all I’m saying is you never see Michael J.

Just keep shooting.Ben: Mike, if I ask you a question about girls will you tell everybody so they laugh at me?Mike: Girls, huh? No, no, no. Ok, alright. The play can wait. Ok, ask away.Ben: Ok. Well, there’s this new girl at school and she’s the only girl in my class who wears a bra. Every time I see her I start sweating and saying dumb stuff. I either want to kiss her or slug her.Mike: Always kiss, never slug.Ben: What if I do kiss her and she slugs me?
Mike: Well, Ben there’s comes a time in your life when you gotta take a chance, you know? I mean, at some point you’re gonna have to stop playing with G.I. Joe.Ben: Maybe I’ll just slug her. Monica: Hi, Mike. Mike: Oh it’s no use, baby. I’m just a bum and there’s no place in the world for a guy like me.Monica: Oh, I think you’re very entertaining. I mean, I think you say all sorts of witty things. And you are a wonderful dancer.Mike: Hey! How’s it going?Monica: Mike! We are going to get these parts, I can feel it!

Thank you for your help.Carol: You mean it?Maggie: No. He means leave the room.Carol: Fine. Look, I just want you both to know, though, however you decide to punish him, I’m solidly behind you.Maggie: Jason, I am going to scream. He skipped his audition.Jason: I thought he was serious about drama. Carol: And for the record, I do think he should be severely punished.Jason: Thank you. Get out!
Jason: This audition would take a lot of guts and very little common sense. Maggie: Ok, that’s Mike alright, but I still think…

Jason: And is that something we really ought to punish?Maggie: So, you’re saying we should hope that Mike didn’t lie to us and cut school to waste time. We should hope that Mike lied to us and cut school to take his chance on Broadway?Jason: Yea, that’s about it.Maggie: But you agree we should punish him?Jason: Absolutely. But then we should take him out for dinner.

biggest lesson I’ve learned is, well, all those old clichés are true. Time does heel all wounds. Life does go on. Twelve year olds do not listen to you. Now look, cos I didn't now it was your birthday, I didn't have time to wrap your present. But take it anyway hu? Its a little advice from an old man. You know, I’ll tell you, I’ve been a lot of things; a bar tender, a veteran, a cowanian, or is it a Rotarian, I can never get that right. Also, I’ve, I’ve also been a husband, a father, a son.

Hey pal, this is not a gift you are going to get every birthday. From now on, you are going to be Big Brother Ben. Ben: Big Brother Ben? Patient: Another thing I’ve learned as a bartended is that if you can’t solve a guys problem, 

Ben: I know. My big brother told it to me. Patient: Well that’s enough of corrupting the morals of a minor. Let’s get back to gambling. Alright, you ready? Ben: Ready. Patient: Got any sevens?

The freedom to fail.Maggie: we gave him the freedom, he failed. Lets go. 

Jason: Ok. Boner: Thanks.

I mean, if you'd just seen there faces, you'd know how impossible it would have been to disappoint them. Mike: Hey, it's never been a problem for me. Carol: And once I've been accepted, it'll be, "Carol, just try it for one semester." Then, they'll say, "ha, might as well get your undergrad degree", then, "why not your PHD." Mike: Hey, anything to get you out of the house, is fine with me. 

Ben: Aha. I got it. I got it. Hey, I'm a kid, not an idiot. No, that's not an attitude, that's the way I feel. Good bye, yourself.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Carol: This baby-care schedule really stinks. Ben: You gonna eat your cereal? Carol: No. This doesn't bother you? Ben: Not if I don't use your spoon. Mike: Morning house dwellers! And cave dweller. Hey, listen, did Mom leave for work yet? Carol: What do you care? Mike: Well, you know, this being her first day back at work and away from the baby, I predict this being one of those sappy, tear filled scenes, that I for one... Mom! Dad! Good morning! Jason: Mike! I'm sure you're gonna feel rotten at first. You're gonna feel like you're abandoning your baby. Yes, you're gonna feel, I'm a terrible mother!!! Maggie: Oh Jason. Jason: I'm sorry, I've gone too far. I'm sorry. Maggie: I'll be OK, just give me a minute. Jason: Hey, we've been planning our schedule for days, it's gonna go like clock-work. Look at this; I got a big board made up and everything. Alright, attention please! What's gonna happen when I'm with patients in the afternoon? Show of hands. Carol Seaver!! Carol: I get out of school at two thirty, I then come straight home and attend to my only sister's every need. Jason: Yes!!! And when Carol can't get right home, Mike Seaver! Mike: My dog ate my homework sir. Jason: Mike. Mike: Alright, I get stuck with Chris. I mean, I'll take care of Chris. Mom, listen, you can count on me to do whatever it takes, to make sure that that little tyke is healthy, happy and gurgling spit. Jason: And on those days when Mike can't make it, for reasons that are hopefully school-related, or legal, Ben Seaver. Ben: I'll do it. I just hope that when it's my turn to change Chrissy's diapers, there's not a bullet in the chamber. Jason: Thank you Ben, for that heart-felt sentiment. Maggie, you see, we're all in this together. Things are gonna work out great, sweetheart. Maggie: Oh, you're right. Besides, you'll be here the whole time too, and the baby should sleep most of the day anyway. Oh, thanks honey. Thanks kids!! Mike: See you later Mom Carol and Ben: Bye Mom!!! Mike: Goodbye, good luck!! Jason: Bye Mom.Maggie: I'll be back before she knows I'm gone. (Baby cries) She knows.

(on the phone) Maggie: I'd forgotten how hectic things could be around here. The pressures, the deadlines, the office politics... Jason: Hey Maggie, if I'd known things would got this smoothly with the baby, I would have kicked you out years ago. Maggie: Honey, that's so sweet. 

Ben: Ha? Mike: You know Dad is really ticked off! Carol ducked out of Chris duty. Ben: Duty? Mike: Yeah. And you're supposed to be filling in. Now I've been covering for you.

There you go, no need to thank me Benny, after all, what are brothers for? Oh, and you might want to check if she needs to...err...you know... Ben: Hey Stink, what are you doing here?

I've got to get back to my baby. Slivervich: Oh, is he sick? Maggie: She. No, it’s my turn on the big board to relieve Jason. Slivervich: The big board? Maggie: Ah, yes, yes Mr. Slivervich. I'm sorry, but I can’t. I uh... Slivervich: Say no more. I'd like to have had a reporter in this hostage situation, but I understand. I mean, when it’s your turn on the old big board, it’s your turn. Walf, how would you like to be a reporter? Policeman: Well it has always been my dream. Slivervich: Good. Policeman: Can I bring my gun? Maggie: Ok, I’ll do it. Policeman: Ok, I won’t bring my gun. 
Jason: Yes, look, excuse me for a minute. You just go ahead.


Mike: aren’t you going to tell us to shut up? Aren’t you at least going to blame somebody? Oh come on. Aren’t you going to yell? Ben: I'm going to my room. This is too spooky. Mike: Alright, alright. We get the picture. They're grounded and I get no cable this month. Fine, no cable for two months. And I’m going to leave right this minute before its three. How about a couple of hot heads! Maggie: Jason, what do we do? Jason: Well I think its time we talked about a concept that we've never really given a fair chance. Maggie: Oh Jason, we can’t leave the kids and run off to Jamaica. Jason: I never thought of that. Maggie: I was kidding. Jason: Well I think that we should be hiring someone to come in here in afternoons, and help

out. I know we always said that we didn’t want a stranger to raise Chris, but I don’t think that a couple of hours of light house work and baby sitting in the afternoon is exactly raising. What do you think? Maggie: Well.. Jason: Well what? Maggie: Jason, maybe I should just stay home. Jason: Honey, come on. That's fatigue and emotions talking. You know how important your career is. Maggie: I just wanted to make sure you knew it too. Oh honey, where do we get someone to do this? I mean it sounds like a tough job to fill. Jason: Yeah, especially with minimum wage. Maggie: Who said anything about minimum wage? 

Julie: I better run. Now Chrissy's asleep in her room. Maggie: Oh. Julie: And dinner will be ready in just a few minutes. Maggie: You cooked dinner. Julie: Uh hu. I'll be back tomorrow at two. And tell Jase goodbye from me. Maggie: Jase!Julie: Oh, well that’s what he wants me to call him. I don’t feel very comfortable doing it, Maggie. Maggie: Mags will be fine. Julie: Bye. Maggie: Bye.

Every time I came out of the office today, she was doing something different.Maggie: So she's a regular miracle worker, hey Jase? Jason: Well she did part the clothes on Ben’s floor. So how was day two at work? Maggie: Don’t try to change the subject with me Jason Seaver. Jason: Pardon me? Maggie: No I come home exhausted from work and find you've hired someone all on your own. Jason: Right.Maggie: What's going on here? Jason: I'm not sure. Well we can talk about it over dinner. Cornish game hen. Ben: Where's Julie? Jason: She just left. Ben: Oh nuts. Maggie: What’s wrong? Ben: We were going to exercise together.Jason: Ben you hate exercise. Ben: Not anymore. Jason: Uh. I think that cute. Maggie: So is Julie. Jason: Yeah. Maggie: Hi Carol. Carol: Bye mum. 
Jason: I just don’t understand it. I mean she's a soft more at Columbia University, majoring in 

child psychology; she practically raised five brothers single handedly. The agent that sent her over couldn’t say enough nice things about her and the moment she picked Chrissy up, Chrissy stopped crying. Maggie: And that impressed you. Jason: Maggie. Maggie: Jason, are you telling me that you didn’t notice her looks at all? Jason: Of course I did. Maggie: Hu! Why don’t you admit it? You like beautiful women. Jason: Guilty. Maggie: Men. Jason: Maggie, I did not take this decision lightly. I interviewed a ton of people today. Maggie: A ton. How many? Jason: Four.

Maggie: Oh, so that makes Julie and, uh, three very large women. Jason: Maggie, if I were hiring strictly on looks, I would have taken the second woman I saw. Oh! Maggie: Well you had quite a day. Jason: I thought we decided last night that I would handle this Maggie. I can’t help it if I got lucky with Julie. Maggie: What? Jason: You know what...I thought you'd be happy that I found someone who's so, so.. Maggie: Young and pretty. Jason: Well clearly I misjudged the way you'd react to Julie. Maggie: Bingo Jase. Jason: Oh come on. This cant all be about the way she looks. Is everything alright at work? Maggie: Well it’s about time you asked. Jason: Oh I did ask Maggie. The first time..oh.Ok, you're right. 

Mike: Hey Ben, look. If you dragged me down here to just to see mum on the news, I got news. I'm not interested.Ben: You will be. Sit down. Julie, mums on!

Julie: Sure. What’s on your mind? Maggie: I should just say this as quickly as I can. Julie: Oh I'm in no hurry. Maggie: Well I am. Julie, you're a sophomore, right? Julie: Uh hu. Maggie: Well what I want to say is... Julie: But I may not graduate in two years. I've been thinking about changing my psych major.Maggie: Uh hu. See well the thing is that I... Julie: Journalism.Maggie: What about it? Julie: Well that’s what I’m thinking of switching to. 
Julie: Maggie holds Chrissy this way to quiet her. Did Maggie call while I was with a patient? 


Maggie would never let Mike get away with that. I'll tell you, I think he really misses you now that you're back at work. Maggie: Do you think? Julie: Between us, I think he's a little jealous. Maggie: Of what.Julie: I mean, he has to share you with the whole city. Most men would be too insecure to share their wives. Maggie: Most women too. Julie: Pardon me? Maggie: Insecurities can drive you crazy. So I’ve heard. Julie: Boy, a husband like that, your family, dream job. You've got it all. I didn’t think it was possible. Maggie: Neither did I.

Mike: Alright. Pick a card, any card. Ok. Alright. Now think of that card. Toni: The whole card? Mike: Yeah, the whole thing. Ok, now, was your card the ace of spades? Toni: No. Mike: Ok, what does that say? Toni: It says...No way, you read my mind! Mike: Yeah. And I can read your thought too. Shame on you. Toni: Shame on you. Mike: Julie!Julie: Don’t mind me. Toni: Mike, who is this woman, and what's she doing with your shorts? Mike: Ah, she's an employee. That will be all my good woman. Julie: Mike, a word. Mike: Later. You know you pay someone a salary and they think they own you. Julie: Mike, you know you are not allowed to have girls in your room. Toni: What are you, babe. Julie: Dinner's on as soon as your mother gets home. Toni: Mother? Mike: Ah, listen. Toni, where were we? Toni: Mike, I'm very sorry but I've got to leave. Mike: Hey, no, no, no, no, Toni. Come on. Don’t listen to Julie. I mean she's just someone that 
my parents hired to take care of my stupid little sister. Toni: No, see. I just don’t date guys who aren't allowed to have girls in their rooms. I have a reputation. Mike: Toni, Toni, Toni. Come on. You just can’t do this. Walking into my room. Turn off the lights. Start talking suggestive, and then just leave? Toni: Mike, I'm dumb, but I’m not stupid.
Mike: hey look Julie. Who the heck gave you permission to come barging up to my place any time you want. And who the heck gave you a key? Julie: You did, right after you said "Julie, come up to my place any time you want".Mike: Look, I withdraw that permission and you give me back my key. You know, you have no right to come barging into my, my uh.. Julie: Into your what? Mike: Into my what what. Julie: You're the one talking.

Now I’m not ruining any weekend plans that you had am I? Julie: Well, I had a date, but its no big deal. I can change it. Maggie: Julie. Julie: Maggie, believe me. Things weren't going anywhere with this guy. He already failed my little Willie test. Maggie: Pardon me? Julie: Oh, well Willie's my little baby brother. See I bring guys to my parents house to meet Willie, and if they start getting real uncomfortable and saying " hey, hey, hey. You're messing with my suit", then I know he's a waste of my time. But if he starts playing around with them and stuff, then I know I’ve gota ... Maggie: A keeper. Julie: Exactly. Pretty nuts hu? Maggie: No, its pretty smart. In fact, could you mention that to Carol, and not make it sound like I said "can you mention that to Carol". Julie: Sure. Now Chrissy's upstairs sleeping. I'm going to go home and pack and be back in an hour. Maggie: Great. See you then. Julie: Ok. 
Maggie: Uh hu. 

Jason: Hi. Maggie: Oh Hi everybody. Sit down, I have wonderful news. Ben: Yeah, like Mike already told us. Dinners on. Maggie: No. It’s even better than that. You know how we've been talking about doing a getaway family weekend? Well how does leaving tonight, for two days in Martha's Vineyard sound? 
Jason: Honey, you know how much those beech houses cost to rent? Carol: So I get stuck watching Chris, while you guys have a great time. Mike: Drop me a card. Maggie: First of all Jason, my boss is letting us use his beach house, free of charge. Jason: Free! Well, well, well, well. Hey, this sounds like fun, hey kids? Maggie: Julie just told me that she can come with us and help out with Chrissy. Carol: Oh great. I'm in. Maggie: And Mike. Well, if you're not interested in a family weekend I don’t... Mike: Mum, mum. I live for family fun. Count me in. 
Jason: So the fact that Julie's coming has nothing to do with your decision to go? Mike: Julie going?Julie: Shhh! She just fell asleep. Jason, if we leave now I think she'll sleep the whole way.

Mike and Julie are going to hit the road now so Chrissy can get some sleep. Maggie: But I wanted the baby with us. Jason: Maggie, lets let sleeping babies lie. Maggie: Enough said. Maggie: Jason, why is a four hour ride taking five hours? Jason: It does not take five hours. 
Well, here we are. A living room, bedroom and indoor plumbing. With a flusher.


Julie: I'll get Chrissy settled upstairs.Mike: I'm sorry, but you look so familiar.Man: Maybe you met my twin brother. Chester. Runs the ferry from the mainland. I got the looks and the personality. He got the ferry.Mike: Right, well my family is going to be coming up on the next ferry, so when does that get here? Man: Tomorrow.Mike: Pardon me? Man: There's no way on or off this island til morning. Unless you've got fins and a blow hole. Ha ha ha. Local joke.Julie: So we are stuck here all night, alone? Man: Little lady.

Julie: You, me and Chrissy. Mike: Oh right. You me and Chrissy. Oh what will they think of next. These sleeping bags zip together. Julie: Mike, I've got to tell you something. Mike: Yes. Julie: And this isn’t easy. Mike: Oh come on Julie. You can tell me, you can tell me anything. Julie: Don’t hit on me tonight. Mike: Almost anything. Julie: I really didn’t mean that the way that it sounded, but.. 

Carol: Hu! Ben: hey. Maggie: Mike, I hope you are going to be a gentleman tonight. Mike: Mum, when have I not been a gentleman? Maggie: Ha ha ha. That’s funny. Listen, I just want you to think of Julie as, well,Mike: You? Maggie: Mike, that’s sick. But you get the idea. Ok, let me talk to Julie. Mike: Ok. Hey Julie, it’s my mum. Julie: Hi.Maggie: Hi Julie.

Maggie: Great. Well thank you Julie. Bye bye. Julie: Bye bye. Jason: Honey, you look worried. Maggie: Well it’s just that it’s my baby’s first night alone. Jason: With a girl. I know.Maggie and Jason: That too. 
Mike: Notice anything different? Julie: You are wearing that silly smoking jacket. Mike: Very observant. It’s not mine though. Julie: I didn’t think so. Mike: Alright Julie. Pick a card, any card and I will read your mind. Ok, was your card the ace of spades? Julie: That’s not it. Mike: Ok, but the answer to my question is.. Julie: It’s another card. 
Mike: A kid. Hu. That’s funny. You really meant that, didn’t you? Julie: Well yeah.Mike: So I have absolutely no shot here, whatsoever? Oh fine. Fine, fine, fine. I was crazy to think that you’d think that I was...You probably think of me the same as you do Ben. Right? Yeah. And I wore a stupid smoking jacket and everything. Julie: Mike. Mike, I didn’t mean to insult you. Maybe it’s just better if we don’t talk. 

Mike: So just to be totally clear, you have absolutely no attraction here what so ever? Julie: I didn’t say that. Mike: So you admit, there is some kind of attraction? Julie: Were you always like this as a child? Mike: Yeah. Pretty much. Maybe a little shorter. What about you. I mean, were you like this when you were a child? Julie: Oh no. When I was a little girl, I was very uptight.Mike: You've come a long way.Julie: Actually I have. I'll tell you something, I was so shy that I didn’t have my first date until I was sixteen.Mike: That's not so weird. I mean I didn’t have my first date until I was...really? Julie: It was hard for me to get to know any boys. We moved around a lot. See my dad was in the marines, and, gosh I’ve lived just about every place in the world where people don’t even

speak English. Maybe I did get asked out before I was sixteen. But I really never knew what they were saying. Mike: So I decided to sign up to Alf Landen Junior college and see what happened 。Julie: But you are serious about wanting to give acting a try？Mike: Yeah，I think so 。I mean it was the only part of high school I was any good at 。But，uh，the thought of actually doing it scares me to death 。That’s something I never told anybody. Julie: Isn’t this kind of neat 。Just talking 。Like friends，and not like，you know 。Mike: Yeah，it is 。Who knew？So，uh，we were talking about the guys you were dating 。Julie: When were we doing that? Mike: Hey look，if you are uncomfortable with the subject of who you are dating，then we can change the subject 。
Julie: Fine 
。Mike: So who‘s dating you？Julie: Ok, I’ve been dating this guy. Mike: There you go. I sit serious? Julie: No. Mike: No, he's probably not into this talking thing like I am. Julie: Well what about you. Was that girl in your apartment your girlfriend? Mike: Toni? Toni, no. Julie: Why, is there something wrong with her? Mike: No, there's nothing wrong with her, it's just that..I don’t know, if I’m going to have a girlfriend, she's got to have...more. Julie: Toni looked like she had plenty to me. Mike: No, I don’t mean more like that. I mean... Julie: Mike, I like you when you don’t know what to say next. Mike: Well gosh. I don’t know what to say next.
Mike: Yeah. What? 

Mike: Yeah, I think I know what you mean. I've dated a lot of girls like Toni before, but, I don’t know, lately its getting tough. I mean, it’s like last week, I went out with this incredibly hot babe at this drive in and I fell asleep. Please don’t ever tell anybody that I told you that.

Julie: You were listening when I was telling your mum about my little Willie test yesterday. Weren’t you? Mike: Hu?
Mike: Uh, Julie. Why are you looking at me like that?Julie: Cos you are not who I thought you were. Mike: Yeah. Well who am I? Julie: You are more. Mike: Oh no. No no no no no. You're going to make me start thinking that I’ve got a shot again, and then you're going to tell em no. Right?Julie: No. Mike: Well then, a no no, or a no yes? Julie: Yes. Mike: Yes yes? Julie: Shut up Mike. (kiss) This can’t happen. I work for your parents. Mike: Oh, oh! Well listen.

Mike: And now that you are nineteen and I’m eighteen, that makes you only....Well the point is, I’m gaining on you. This way, I could maybe even pass you. Julie: But, don’t pass me Mike.Mike: Maybe just catch up. Julie: Chrissy needs changing. Mike: Yeah. Mike: Hey Julie.. Julie: Uh hu? Mike: It was nice spending the night with you.

Maggie: Why. Jason: Cos I believe him. Maggie: Jason, I don’t see them together. They don’t have much in common. Jason: Well I can see the attraction in Freudian terms. You know men are often attracted to women who remind them of their mothers. Maggie: Oh, you think Julie reminds him of me? Jason: Yeah. Sure. She's blond, she's smart. She's cute. Not much of a sense of hu.....Hu li li.

I've betrayed your trust.Maggie: Yes, but what's important here ... Carol: And I have never done that before. At least not for something as serious as this. So I guess under the circumstances, I understand why you grounded me for three weeks.Jason: Well uh, I’m glad we can have this little talk. Carol: You wanted to say something?Jason: Uh, I think we've pretty much covered it now.Carol: I'm sorry. Maggie: Oh honey, that’s ok. I mean it’s not Ok. I mean. You know what I mean.

We have learned exclusively that the head of the sanitation workers local, Harry Spreckles, is meeting in secret session at the home of Long Island garbage Tsar, Reg Cohen, at his Jamaica Bay town house. We do not know the nature of their discussions, or when they will emerge, but I'll be standing by live, to let you know which way the wind is blowing. We now rejoin Channel nineteen’s exclusive presentation of "Ishtar". Chaz, never wear heels to cover a garbage story.(phone rings)Hello, oh good. Mr. Siblovich, I wanted to talk to you. How long do you expect me to be tarnded out...I know a gown is not appropriate attire. No, I frankly wasn’t planning to cover a garbage strike. He thinks I’m showing too much cleavage for a work stoppage. Mr. Siblovich, isn’t there someone else who could relieve me? See, I . There isn't. Well look at is this way, nobody is watching. We are running "Ishtar" tonight for crying out loud. No, I’m sorry. I lost my head. I just wanted to accept this award tonight with all my heart and soul. But I know my job comes first. Not to mention my personal loyalty to you. No, Mr. Siblovich, I’m not just saying that. Right. Goodnight. Well, looks like we are going to be spending the night together. Chaz: The gown was a thoughtful touch.
Maggie: What if this isn’t the garbage Czars house? What if it’s the garbage Dukes?(Phone rings) Maggie: Hello. Yes I’ll accept a collect call. Hi Jason.Singers: Yes, we have no bananas. We have no bananas today. Jason: Honey, we are just about through with the entertainment programme. Mercifully. Look, are you going to be able to make it? Maggie: No.

Well see since my husband as out of town, I was going to spend all night working on my acceptance speech. But see, it just didn’t turn out that way. 
(Flash back to the last twenty four hours) Maggie: Michael Seaver, do you have nay idea what time it is? Its three o clock in the morning. Mike: Well mum. I was just, uh, uh, what the heck are you doing?

How could I do that?Carol: Mum you humiliated me right in front of Ron.Maggie: Carol Ron should never have been here in the first place. You can’t date men like that. Carol: Mum, I know what you are thinking. And just cos the man has a little bald spot.. Maggie: Carol, the man doesn’t have a little bald spot. The man is bald.(phone rings)

A funny thing happened to her on the way to the banquet tonight. She knew she's forgot something and then she remembered, her opening joke. Ha ha ha . Kids: Ha ha ha.Ben: That man told us to laugh.Jason: So uh, I don’t think I could possible do justice to my wife’s wonderful speech, so I think I’ll just share with you my impression of my wife.Mike: If this is as bad as his Sylvester Stallone impression, these babes are going to tear him apart. Jason: I think its best summed up in one moment from last night. I had been away on a trip and it was very late....

You know it’s kind of late and I sure appreciate that you did and I love you...I wanted to talk to you. Are you sleeping? Sweetheart? Sweetheart. (baby crying) Maggie: The baby.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Mike: Alright, the king is mean. The king is lean. He's shooting. Here he goes. He’s up to three... Boner: Mikey. Its four am. Any time to get some studying done? Mike: relax. You are acting like this is finals week. Boner: It is. Mike: Yes! One hundred and eighty. In a row. Can he go for a record one hundred and ninety? Boner: Mikey, I think I need to study more than you need that record. Mike: Boner relax. We've got a whole five hours. There's plenty of time to practice for this history final. Boner: Science final. Mike: Whatever. Come on. Don’t be so tense. Boner: Mikey, I’ve been doing some thinking. Mike: A very dangerous thing for you to be doing Boner. Especially during finals week. Boner: I've been asking myself certain questions. Mike: Hey, if they are not multiple choice, you aint got a shot. Boner: Mikey no, no.. Mike: hey Bone. Just look at yourself. You look like you are three feet tall with your legs growing out of your armpits. Alright alright, we'll study. I hate to see a dwarf with a bad attitude. I mean come on. Cheer up Bone. Remember the schools policy; First semester freshmen can not flunk out. Even if their grades are as lousy as ours. Boner: Well now that you are in serious mode, can I talk to you about something? Come here. Mike: Sure, let me get comfortable here. Speak! Boner: Ok, this thought has been bouncing around my head like a rubber ball. We can’t go through college, the way we've been doing, for much longer. I mean, we aint High School anymore. Things are changing. I can grow facial hair. Now I’ve been thinking about making some big, big changes in my life. Do you ever feel that just getting by is getting old? (Mike snoring) Guess not! (A Week Later) (The Day the Grades Arrive) Julie: Ben, you got some mail. Ben: from who? Julie: Ed MacMan. Ben: Never heard of him. Mike: Hey Ben, has anyone brought the mail in yet? Ben: (speaking with food in his mouth) Mike: Would you take that thing out of your mouth.Ben: Well how else am I supposed to eat it? Mike: Look, do you know? I got to look through it before mum and dad do. Ben: They just got it. Mike: What did you give it to them? How could you do that to me you little doof.

Julie: What's going on in here? Ben: It’s Mike. He's gone crazy. It’s about the mail. Julie: I just brought it into your parents. There was something for you. Ben: You're in big trouble Julie. Mike: Well thank you Julie. That was just so sweet of you to go out of your way like that.Ben: Why is he so nice to you? What have you got that I haven’t got? Mike: Hey, good morning mum and dad. Looking through the mail I see. Jason: Expecting your new issue of "Boys Life"? Mike: No.Jason: Well how about this letter from the Alf Landen Junior College? Maggie: Office of the registrar. Mike: Hey what so you know. My old pal the registrar. Maggie: Midsemester grades Mike? 

Mike: Bone, what’s going on here? Boner: Sometimes a man's got to do what a man's got to do. 
Jason: I still want to offer the thought, Maggie, that we don’t know for a fact that Mikes grades were bad.Maggie: Oh honey, you look so cute when you are being foolish and naive. Jason: I know. I mean about being naive. Maggie: When’s Mike going to wake up and smell the future? Jason: Well it’s my dream that someday something's going to hit him. Maybe he'll hear voices say "Its time Mike, its time". Looking cute again? Maggie: Adorable. Still Jason, we can’t ignore this. We have to let him know that we are disappointed. Jason: I agree, but I don’t think it would do any good yelling at him.'

Maggie: Well I agree.Jason: Hey Mike. How are you doing? Maggie: You hungry?Mike: Mum, dad, I know what you are both thinking here, so I won’t keep you in suspense. Now mum, you were right. That letter I got in the mail today, was my grades. Can you pass the salt? Maggie: And? Mike: The pepper. Maggie: And? Mike: Please. Carol: Should Ben and I wait upstairs until you are done yelling at Mike? Jason: No.Carol: Come on in Ben. We get to watch. Jason: There's not going to be any yelling. Ben: Is there going to be any food? Jason: Yes. Ben: I'll stay.

Carol: Don’t do anything gross Boner. We are eating. Boner: From the holes of Montessori, to the shores of Tripoli. What do you think? Mike: I think his main engine just went down. Ben: Where did you get the neat hat? Boner: As of two pm this afternoon, one pm central, it is official. I am a Marine. I see you are speechless from the heavyosity of my news.Mike: You did what?

Boner: Now listen. I got to go home and tell my parents about this. Yours was on my way home and I couldn’t resist coming in and sharing my joy. Nough said. Mike: No Boner. That is not nearly nough said.Boner: Oh, I forgot. As you were.
(At Boner house) Boner: Hey Mikey. Let me turn this off. Neighbors: Finally.Mike: Hey Bone. Let’s talk about this Marine thing. Alright. Boner: Sure Mike. I've been wanting to talk to you. Mike: Now what you said about joining the Marines isn’t like what you said about what you and Angela Scoffengelio did? Boner: No, no, no, no. The Marine thing is true. 
Mike: Oh no. Boner: What? Mike: Well maybe there's still hope. You didn’t sign anything did you? Boner: Well my name. Mike: Oh no. Boner: And I took a test. Mike: That you probably had to pass. Alright, you are out of this deal. Boner: I passed. Mike: You passed! Boner, did you have to pick a time like this to pass a test? Boner: Yep. And in two weeks I leave for basic and beautiful sunny San Diego. Mike: Oh Bone. Why didn’t you jut think before you ran off and did some crazy thing like this?Boner: Well Mikey I have been thinking about this. For a long time. And when I got my grades today I realized what I had to do. Mike: Well Boner why didn’t you just tell me that you were having these crazy thoughts. Boner: Well I was going to, but figured you didn’t want to hear about it. See it all started when I was... Mike: I don’t want to hear about it. Do you have any idea what you are doing? I mean this is the marines. These are the guys who wake up when it’s dark and run for six miles. I mean they also carry guns. Do you really want to join an organization that’s going to trust you with a loaded gun?Boner: Mikey, I aint going to be anywhere near guns. I signed up for artillery.
Boner: You know I expected you to be a little nicer to me about this. You're supposed to be my best friend. Mike: Bone I am your best friend. That’s why I am telling you if you join the Marines you are 
Boner: Mikey, I didn’t just join the army or the navy or the National Guard. I joined the Marines. Mike: I should have known you were nuts the first day you showed up without your pants.Boner: Hu? Mike: In the first grade. When you showed up in your over coat and your underwear.Boner: I didn’t forget my pants. My mum dressed me that day. I told you that a hundred times.
Mike: Come on, there's got to be a way to get you out of this somehow. I got it. My dads a psychiatrist, he's always saying how you're nuts. We'll just get him to write it down. Boner: Mikey I don’t want to get out of this.Mike: Come on Bone, you can’t let a bad report card spook you like this. Boner: It’s easy for you to say. You got D's.Mike: Alright, what about your future? Boner: Mikey, until I joined the marines, I didn’t have a future. In eight weeks I could be driving a thirty million dollar tank.Mike: Boner, I couldn’t even teach you a stick shift! Now look, I’m telling you, if you join the Marines, you are just going to upset your whole life. What did your parents say? Boner: They cried. Mike: See.Boner: They said they’d never been prouder of me. You know my dad was a Marine. He said

Boners Dad: Sure, a couple of minutes will be fie. Boners mum: And how are you tonight Mikey? Mike: Oh I’m fine. And how are you guys? Boners dad: Damn fine Mikey. We are just so tickled pink about Richards’s decision. Mrs Stabone actually wept in her linguini.Mike: Wo. Boners Mum: It will be hard not having him around, but what a wonderful thing he's doing, for himself and for our grateful nation.Boners Dad: hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We'll wait for you inside Richard.Boner: Yeah. Boners Mum: Goodnight Mikey. Mike: Goodnight. Boners dad: Goodnight Seaver. Mike: Hey.(Parents go in crying) Boy. Boner: Yeah. They are finally calming down.Mike: Man, they are nuttier than you are.Boner: Hey mike. That’s a very rude thing to say. 
Boners Dad: Richard! Time to say goodbye to Mikey. 


Mike: That’s exactly what it means. 
Jason: Phew! I thought for a minute that it was a clumsy burglar. Mike: I mean Boner actually joined the Marines. Can you believe that dad? Jason: Well.. Mike: Yeah. That dweeb leaves for basic and training in two weeks.Jason: Why, what are you so angry about? Mike: Haven’t you heard a word I said dad? He just joined the Marines. Jason: Well shouldn’t it be the Marines who are upset? Come on Mike. I mean I understand you being upset about your best friend going away, but where is all this anger from? Mike: Because dad, he's making a big mistake. I mean you should have heard him tonight. I was pathetic. He was babbling some nonsense about making a decision about what he wants to do with his life. About picking his future before it picks him.

Ben: If Mike doesn’t show up, can I have his ravioli? Everyone: No. Maggie: Where is Mike anyway? He's usually home from work by dinner time. Ben: They could have had an emergency at the carwash. Carol: An emergency. What a bug storm on the expressway? Jason: Carol, there's nothing wrong with having a part time job that involves a little physical labor. The money helps Mike pay his way around here. Carol: So I could get a part time job too? Jason: To pay your way around here? Carol: Heck no. I mean of course to help pay my way around here. Jason: I don’t know. What do you think Maggie? Maggie: Fine. As long as you don’t become a topless dancer. Carol: Oh great. I’ll start pouting the pavement tomorrow. Ben: Look out pavement. Mike: Hey. Sorry I’m late guys. Emergency overtime. Bug storm on the expressway. You know, you know I hate my job, if I could find anything else I’d jump at it. The only good thing about this stupid carwash job is payday. Boy its Saturday and I am ready to party. Jason: Payday! Well then you're also ready to pay this months rent. Mike: Yeah, no problem. Jason: And last months rent. Mike: Uh, no problem. Carol: So you can also pay me back the twenty dollars you borrowed? Mike: No.. Carol: No problem. Mike: Hey. Alright, now what the heck am I supposed to do with two dollars? 
Ben: You could come play some video games with me. Mike: Bennie, a college man has much more important things to do on a Saturday night than destroying galaxies with his dweebie little brother. Ben: I'll buy. Mike: Let’s roll.
Ben: Wow. You just mad intergalactic assassin! Mike: Words cannot express my joy. Ben: Want another burrito? Mike: No. I'm still tasting that last one. You know Bennie, there's got to be more to life than working in a stupid car wash and eating burritos that repeat. Ben: So get another job. Mike: I've been looking for a new job for the passed three weeks. You know a job is not easy to find. Ben: Sure it is. Excuse me; do you need any help here?

Mike: What silly little robbery story?Manager: Oh forget it. So what's on your mind? Mike: Listen Nick, I know that I am new here, so I don’t even expect you to consider this, but I told my mum that I would at least ask and make the request.Manager: No, no, no. I cannot make you the manager. Not in the first week. Only kidding. Mike: Right. Well, see, I want to be able to honestly tell my mother that I asked to be put on a safer shift. So there. I asked. You listened. Thanks.

Ben: Yes, yes, yes. Jason: What you did last night was wrong. Now we have to know where you are at all times, and that’s not negotiable. Alright? Now what do you have to say for yourself? Ben: Just that I love you both very very much. Jason: You don’t have the chops for that Mike stuff, ok. But you're getting there, and that scares me. Ben: Thank you. Jason: That was not a compliment Ben. Come on, now I want an explanation. Ben: Any Bowen is so pretty. I just wanted to go out with her. Just her and me for a whole movie. Which by the way was rated G.Jason: Well Ben, don’t think I don’t remember what its like being a twelve and a half year old boy. Ben: All I know is that whenever I see Amy shoot those red banks out of her eyes, I just melt.

Jason: Well there is something about red heads, isn’t there. For me it was freckles. Ben: What? Jason: Yeah, I can still remember Rosalind Bladder hanging from that jungle gym. Freckles from here to Tuesday.Ben: Amy has this really cute way of touching your arm when you're reaching for a pencil. Jason: Like it was an accident? Ben: Yeah, but she knows she's doing it.Jason: Oh Ben, they all know.Ben: Dad I know I wouldn’t have done any of that bad stuff if I had been able to think.Jason: Don’t be so hard on yourself Ben. Ben: But I disappointed you. Jason: Look, you went to a movie. That’s all you did. With a girl. I'd be a little disappointed if you didn’t. Ben: Dad, I snuck....go on. 

Carol: Dad, I know what I did was wrong.. Jason: You bet it was.Carol: But if.. Jason: Did you know the rules? Carol: Well yes. Jason: Did you break the rules? Carol: Yes.. Jason: Were you under the control of alien beings? Carol: Hu! Jason: No. Then you are grounded for two weeks. Carol: Two weeks! Dad I’ve learned my lesson. You have my assurance that this will not happen again. Jason: Wait a minute. That’s exactly what you said the last time this happened. So you are

Mike: Alright Bennie! You got a warning! You are almost as good as I was when I was your age.Ben: That’s what dad said. Mike: Wow. I made an impression on the man.Carol: What are you so happy about squirt? Ben: My punishment. Carol: Yeah, well I guess a month of grounding doesn’t mean much to someone with your limited horizons.Mike: Dad grounded you for a month? Carol: Uh hu. Mike: You know my respect for that man grows more and more every day.Carol: Why? What did you get Ben? Ben: Well, I don’t think I should tell you. Carol: Come on Ben. How long were you grounded for? Ben: Well.. Carol: Two weeks? Ben: Uh.. Carol: One week? Ben: Not exactly. Carol: What what? Mike: Hey hey. Get off his back. He got a warning. Carol: A warning! A stinking warning!Ben: Plus my word that I would never do it again.Carol: Well pardon me while I pop my pantyhose. 
Carol: Mum! Maggie: Carol, it won’t do you any good to appeal your punishment to me. Your father spoke for both of us. Carol: mother, there is something I must tell you. There is a sexist male in out midst. Maggie: What sleazy thing did mike say to you? Carol: Mum, I’m talking about a bigger pig. A man you married.Maggie: Carol, that is very disrespectful. No one calls your dad a pig, but me.

TV: Ewing shoots. Yeah! Ben, Mike and Jason: Yeah!Maggie: Jason honey, have you got a second? Jason: Yeah, in a minute honey. Nicks are down by two. Last minute of the game.Maggie: See Carol has this silly idea that .... Jason: He's done it! Ben, Mike and Jason: Yeah! TV: Driving, driving, yeah! Mike: Yes, it’s all tied up.Maggie: Oh, this is almost as good as you getting off with no punishment. Ben: You said it.Maggie: Jason.

Jason: Yeah, the next commercial honey.TV: He's got it. He's making a dribble drive down the lane. This could be the game. He shoots and it’s in. Ben, Mike, Jason: Ahhh! Maggie: The next commercial is here. Jason: Maggie, what is it? We got Ewing dribble driving down the lane here!Maggie: Is television really more important than family life?Ben: It is to me. Maggie: Ben, go to your room now.Mike: Look, I’m going too. And dad look, I don’t know what Seaver rule you broke, but you are in big big trouble.Maggie: Mike we are just going to have a simple discussion.Mike: Alright. But just one word of advice for you dad. Remember you're a man. 

Jason: Honey, what’s your point? Maggie: I think that Ben got off easy because he's a guy. Jason: I don’t like what you are accusing me of. Maggie: Well I don’t feel so hot myself. Jason: Come on. Don’t you remember back in the days when you were burning bras? I was always there with a full box of matches. You'll laugh later. Maggie: Jason, I don’t know what to say.Jason: Honey, I think you are just looking at this in very simplistic terms. Maggie: Simplistic?Jason: It doesn’t matter what I say or do right now does it? You are going to be stuck there in this illogical rut. Maggie: Illogical rut? Jason: Oh my choice of words may not be ideal. I'm sorry.

Maggie: But isn’t that what you meant? Jason: Why are you offended? I'm the one being accused of being a sexist. Maggie: If the snout fits, wear it.Jason: Well then if you didn’t think that I could handle the punishment fairly, why did you agree to coin flip? Maggie please. Come down here. Both of us, we should just calm down. Maggie: Oh, and forget that I’m a simplistic illogical female stuck in a rut. Jason: I'm game if you are. 
Maggie: Ben, Ben, Ben.Ben: Yes, yes, yes.Maggie: You know the rules of the house? Ben: Yeah, and I thought one of them was that you couldn’t get tried for the same crime twice. Maggie: No Ben, that’s the United States. This is Seaver land. 
Maggie: Wow. Carol: I know. Well anyway, when he asked me out yesterday, I was afraid to tell you. I mean, this guy is so cute, dad would have hated him for sure.

Maggie: That cute hu? Carol: Cuter. Well anyway, you know, I’ve been flirting with him for weeks to ask me out. But not too much, because I didn’t want him to think that I was a tease. But on the other hand, I didn’t want him to think that I was a cold fish. Oh mum, being seventeen can be so horrible. Maggie: Oh honey. Carol: You know, I thought that Charlie might be interested in me when I noticed that he always seemed to be tying his shoe by my locker. When then shelly said it wasn’t an accident and he knew what he was doing. Maggie: Carol, they all know. Carol: And mum, he looks so adorable in his gym shorts. Maggie: Oh those gym shorts. Did I ever tell you about Clud Tyler?Carol: No. Maggie: Well he was on the basketball team, and I was a cheerleader. We went steady all

Ben: That is the most unfair thing I’ve ever heard. 

Mike: If I were you Bennie boy, I would not stand for this. I know sexism when i smell it. Carol: Me too. It smells like cheap cologne. Jason: Well my point is, is that maybe your punishment gave out children the wrong message. Maggie: What? Jason: Yeah. That certain mothers can give certain daughters certain breaks.Maggie: Oh Jason, are you accusing me, Ms Maggie Malone, or sexism? Jason: If the bra fits, burn it. Maggie: Oh Jason, you can’t help but feel this way. I mean, you're just blinded by your own narrow mindedness. Jason: Narrow-mindedness? Maggie: Possibly my choice of words was perfect. Jason: That’s incredible. You don’t even know how wrong you are.Maggie: Didn’t you let your son off Scot free?

Jason: Didn’t you let your daughter off Scot free. Maggie: Well I just gave my daughter a little understanding because I know how tough it is to be seventeen, female, and dealing with boys.Jason: And I know how confusing it is to be a boy who suddenly wakes up one day and finds he would trade his immortal soul just for a nice view of freckles. I can’t say it any clearer.Maggie: Jason, can’t you even consider the possibility that you were easier on Ben than Carol? Jason: Of course I was.Maggie: What? Jason: Not because I’m sexist Maggie. Its just common knowledge. Both parents are always much tougher on daughters than sons. Maggie: oh it’s not common anything. Jason: Well it should be.Maggie: Men are such jerks. That's why I was so tough on Ben.Jason: Maggie, listen to yourself. Maggie: well I do know this, I am no more sexist than, than,.. Jason: Than I am? Maggie: Yes.Jason and Maggie: Oh Boy! Jason: You want to hug a sexist? Maggie: Do you? Jason: I'm thinking.

Carol: Wait, I can’t hear you.TV: Ok Paul. I understand about the Nazi thing, but why are you guys wearing red platted skirts? It’s not a skirt, it’s a jumper.Carol: Ben, I can’t hear a word Sandy's saying.Ben: Shhh. Julie: You guys. I juts put Chrissy down for a nap. Can you please be quiet? (Baby crying) Jason: Hey guys. Give me a break. Come on. I've got to do some work. Carol: I'm just trying to carry on a simple conversation here. TV Why do you shave your head? I don’t. Crusty does.Jason: Come on. First of all it’s too loud. Secondly its time to .... Mike: Hey dad. Would you please check out my homework assignment? What did I say? Jason: What did you say? Mike in twelve years you've never asked me to check out your homework. I don’t know what to say. Mike: Well I just want you to check out the grade I got on this psychology assignment.Jason: Sure. Yeah great. Hey this means a lot to me. You have no idea. For you to come to ...a C minus! Mike: Yeah. That’s what I want to talk about. Jason: I wait twelve years. I get a C minus. Mike: Dad, look. I worked my butt off for that grade, you know. I mean I should have deserved a B. I think the teacher just hates me. You're a psychiatrist. Would you just check my answers?Jason: Wo. You even remember what I do for a living. I better sit down.Mike: You know when Theo has a problem, Bill Cosby never jokes.Jason: Ok, now look. Let’s see. Common definitions of common psychological complexes. 
There's your first problem. It’s an oedipo complex mike, not and edible complex.Mike: This is a psych class, not a spelling class. I mean the point is I put down the right answers. It’s when a guy wants to date his mum. Ben: Then you're in luck. Its guys who date their mums, we call the Donahue. 
Mike: There's never any mustard around when you are in the mood for something oedipo.Julie: Mike, dinners in the oven, so don’t fill up on all of that. Mike: Look. I'm just trying to get something to eat. Would that be ok with you?Julie: Well excuse the holy heck out of me. Mike: Hey. You cursed at me. Hey look Julie, come on. I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s just that, I don’t know, ever had one of those days when you just feel completely... Julie: All the time.Julie: and then I just think about you, and I feel better. Mike: Really? Julie: Really.

Mike: Ahh. Hey, how about that. I feel better. I'd love to feel great. Julie: Mike. Your dads in the living room. You don’t want him to find out about us. Mike: Right, right, right. But we're still going to study together tonight at your place, right?Julie: You bet. Mike: Right.Julie: The key word is study. Mike: The key word for me was together. Of course, the other key word was your place. Actually that is two key words; your and place, but uh.. Julie: I'll see you at seven. Mike: Ok. Julie: And this time, bring your books. Jason: Hey Mike, look I know you are upset and.. Mike: About what? Oh, oh,right. You better believe I’m upset dad. You know this C minus 

Maggie: Ok Jason, you looked at Mikes homework. Was it graded unfairly?Jason: Mike’s answers are imprecise. I told him that in college, especially psychology, it requires a certain clarity that he's not used to. Yes he needs to have an ability to communicate clearly, without the hyperbole, which while acceptable before is now clearly unclear.Maggie: I have no idea what you just said. Jason: It’s like in kindergarten. Remember how mike used to complain that Mrs. Kling made him work with the hardest clay. Then I went down there and I pointed out “Mike, your little piles just as soft as the other kids". I've done it again. Maggie: Pardon me. Jason: Well I just told him that all through his life he's going to run into people that make it tough for him over ways he's doesn’t even deserve. First of all it’s going to be a teacher, then a boss, then a co worker, finally it’s a wife-fool ourselves, life’s tough! You had to be there. Maggie: I was.

Jason: I told him about Dr Hancock. Remember? Remember how I hated that guy, then I grew to respect him, yea revere him. Maggie: Revere him! Jason you still hate him and you wouldn’t even shake his hand at the reunion. And ha ha ha you called him that awful nickname.Jason: Maggie, I was parenting. Don’t muddy things up with the way they really happened. Maggie: Oh Jason, you still haven’t really answered my question. Is he going to drop the class, or what? Jason: Hey, right now he's up in his apartment, he doing his make up assignment and he’s leaned a valuable lesson. Maggie: You're sure about that? Jason: Honey, when the old communicator steps in, you can put that in the bank. (Goes to Mikes room) Mike, it’s only me. Brought a little snack to study with. Mike? Mike, you in there? Hey. Mike: Hey dad.
Jason: So, how did you do in that psychology make up assignment? 


Maggie: Not well, I cut class today. How you doing Ben? Ben: Standing by. Jason: I thought you were Mike. Maggie: Well, you were pretty close. He was behind me at the stop light. Why what’s going on?Hi Mike. Jason: So how did that darn psychology make up go?Mike: I ate it. He gave me a D. Jason: Ah ha ha. And why do you suppose he gave you such a goo...a D! Mike: Yeah I know. I should have deserved at least a B. Jason: Well never mind a B, you should have gotten an A. Maggie: Oh Jason, lets not get carried away here. Jason: No, I tell you. All of these answers are correct.

Mike: You bet they are. Jason: I know they are. I wrote them.Mike and Maggie: What? Jason: Mike Seaver didn’t get a D here. Doctor Jason Seaver did. Ben: Ah dad. No offence, but I think I’ll figure my homework out by myself.Maggie: You wrote Mike's Psychology answers and got a D? Jason: Well... Mike: You don’t know this stuff and you are charging people? Jason: All of these answers are correct. I don’t understand it. Mike: Well I do. If my name is on that paper, right answers are marked wrong. Maggie: Mike, you are getting carried away here. This is the clay thing all over again.Mike: Hey look mum. You can argue with me, but you can’t argue with this. Dad, I wasn’t sure about dropping this course until today, but I can’t thank you enough. Jason: This should have worked Maggie. It was a great idea. Maggie: How much do you charge your patients? 
Jason: Ah ha. Maggie: Jason, its two o clock in the morning. What are you doing? 

Jason: Yes. He's in your intro to psych class. Curly hair, funny kid. Rosenfeld: Well I’ve got three hundred students in that lecture class. At least a hundred of them have curly hair. All of them think they are very funny. Jason: I bet. Well I just came here to maybe clear up a little misunderstanding over his make up assignment. Rosenfeld: Excuse me, but I always like to make a note when something bizarre happens. Jason: Bizarre. Rosenfeld: Preposterous, ludicrous, queer.Jason: Yes, I know what it means. Yes.Rosenfeld: In all my years as a college professor, I’ve never had a parent teacher conference. Jason: Oh well don’t think of me as a parent. Rosenfeld: Oh, so you're not a parent? Jason: No, no, yes I am a parent. But I would like to talk to you, if I may, colleague to

colleague. Rosenfeld: Colleague!Jason: Equal, comrade, peer. Rosenfeld: Associate, co-agiter, messmate. I could go on.Jason: I wish I had a little book to write in. I am a psychiatrist. Rosenfeld: Oh, well why didn’t you say so? Please sit down sir. Sit down, that’s wonderful. Are you an educational psych? Jason: No, private practice.Rosenfeld: Oh, that's great. I almost went that route myself. Jason: Well, just invest in a leather couch here and you are half way there.Rosenfeld: Pipe? Jason: No, I don’t smoke. Thank you.Rosenfeld: Neither do I. So, doctor Seaver, what’s on your mind?

Jason: Am not. Rosenfeld: Yes you are. Jason: AM not.Rosenfeld: Are are are. Jason: Am not, not, not. Look, this is not my sons work bob, pal, best mate. I wrote these answers myself.Rosenfeld: Well then I definitely should re-evaluate this grade. Jason: Thank you very much. I should hope so. You are using a red pen. Rosenfeld: No. Crimson.

I thought we were studying for psych tonight.Mike: How would you like to stand on the wind blown deck of the Stanton island ferry and watch the sun go down and the lights of Manhattan come up? Julie: Uh. Would you be with me? Mike: Of course I’d be with you. Julie: Then I don’t want to go. Mike: What? Julie: Mike, you can’t keep ignoring your problems in psych class. Mike: I'm not. I'm dropping the class.Julie: You're what? But you... 
Mike: Hey mum, between the two of us, I think the man's slipped a clog.

Jason: Shrub, small tree, president of the United States.Maggie: You're definitely on to something.Jason: I'll be the first to concede that things didn’t go exactly as I’d planned. Maggie: What things?Jason: Ok, I’ll tell you. But keep in mind there is some good news. All the way at the end.Maggie: Why don’t we come right to the good news.

Mike: Dad, that is the worst thing you could possibly have done.Jason: That’s exactly what I told your mother. Mike: I can’t believe this. My daddy goes to see my college professor!

Carol: Sandy is not my boyfriend. Maggie: He's not? Jason: Well but from the amount of time you've been spending with... Carol: He has never said that I’m his girlfriend, so I’m not going to say that he’s my boyfriend first. I mean, if he hears that I think he's my boyfriend, and he doesn’t think that I should think that I’m his girlfriend, I’d sound pretty silly wouldn’t I? Mike: Hope you're rolling on that one Ben. Sandy: Hi. Carol: hello.Mike: Hello. Maggie: Mike! Mike: Hey, I was just being polite. How do I look Bennie? Ben: Great. Mike: Yeah. Camera loves me. Jason: How are you this evening Sandy?

Jason: Uh hu. Maggie: He's polite, he's bright, he's ideal for Carol. Jason: Uh hu. Maggie: You know I bet no matter how perfect the guy was that she brought home, you'd still be suspicious.

Jason: I don’t think so. I can call the phone company and check. Carol: No. Sandy might call and get a busy signal.Jason: Honey, we have call waiting. Carol: Well not if the phone is broken.Jason: And we won’t find out if I don’t call. Carol: Why are these men tormenting me? Maggie: Jason. 

Dugg: Well this doc said he's not out of the woods yet, but I don’t get it. I mean he seems ok to me. Oh sure, he's banged up and everything, but we were just talking, even joking. He said that I look worse than he does. Probably do. I mean like Sandy said, at least he got some sleep last night. Look, I’ll be honest with you. I've been here since three am. I've had fifteen cups of coffee. Are you Carol’s parents?Maggie: Yes. Maggie Seaver. Dugg: Hi. Jason: Jason Seaver. Dugg: Hi. Dugg Wallet. Sandy's room mate. Nice to meet you.Jason: Yeah. I'll see what I can find out.Carol: My dad's a doctor. Maggie: Are his family here? Dugg: No, no. His folks are out of town. I talked to his dad. He said they're flying back and

supposed to be here tonight.Carol: Can I see him? Dugg: Maybe, if you play your cards right. Carol, see they only let relatives in to intensive care. I told this nurse, who by the way looks exactly like Larry Bud Melmum, that uh, I was Sandy's brother, so you could just tell her you're his sister. Alright, I'll go get her. Anyone beside me need some coffee?Maggie: I think you should get some food too Dugg. Dugg: Food. Great idea.Carol: I still can’t believe this is happening mum. I mean Sandy's going to be ok. He's got to.Maggie: We will all think good thoughts sweetheart.Carol: He missed the Deans luncheon today. He's really going to be upset. Jason: They tell me Sandy's hemoglobin is stable at this point. Maggie: What does that mean? 
Jason: Well, that means he's alright for now.Maggie: Honey, sometimes a friendly face can do more good than any medicine can. Right Jason? Jason: Right. Nurse: You're friend, Mr. Coffee, tells me someone's here to see Sandy Calison.Carol: Yes, I am. I'm his sister, these are my parents and they'll vouch for me. Nurse: So, you're Sandy's parents. Carol: No. Oh. Alright, I’m not very good at lying. Nurse: We restrict visitors to immediate family. Carol: I'm his fiancée. Jason: Fiancée! Carol: It’s true. Maggie: She's not lying. Jason: You have our word. Nurse: You're still her parents? Jason: I think so. 
Carol: Sandy. Sandy: Carol. Carol: Hi. 
Sandy: well, to tell you the truth I don’t feel so hot. I got so many tubes and wires in me. I got HBO now.
Sandy: Not as much as I’m going to be in when my dad gets here. Carol: Sandy, I am so sorry this happened to you. I'm going to be ok. My car on the other hand, that’s who you 
Sandy: Well this big tree ran right out in front of me. And I’m going to be charged with drink driving. 
Carol: But I don’t understand. I mean it’s not like we had that much to drink. Sandy: I know. I mean there've been plenty of times I’ve put away a lot more than that, and nothing happened. I guess I just ran out of luck last night. Carol: Are you kidding? I mean when you think of what could have happened. You were really lucky. So you lost a car. The important thing is that you are going to be alright. You got a second chance now and you are never going to do anything like that again. Right? Sandy: Right. Listen, could you do the talking when my dad gets here? I mean you could probably get me a new car. Carol: So how long do they say they are going to keep you here? Sandy: I don’t know. The nurse says these internal injuries can be pretty tricky. Don’t you think she looks a little like..? Carol: Larry Bud Milmen. Yeah. You know Sandy, I didn’t know how much I liked you until I found out you were hurt. Maybe that’s hwy it happened. I mean they say everything happens

for a reason. Right. I mean maybe this accident was a good thing for both of us. Sounds dumb, doesn’t it?Sandy: No. But now that you've found out that I’m going to be ok, do you like me any less?Carol.Carol: I'm thinking. Sandy: So, have you ever kissed a guy with tubes up his nose before?Carol: Up his nose, no. Sandy: Careful, they are monitoring my heart rate. Carol: Can I get you anything? Sandy: I wouldn’t mind a beer.Carol: What! How can you... Sandy: Carol. That was a joke. Believe me, its going to be a long time before I bend my elbow again.Carol: Obviously. Ha ha ha. Sandy: Carol, let your boyfriend get the laughs. Please.Carol: Ok. Your girlfriend will just sit here and be quiet. Nurse: Miss. You'll have to go. Carol: Just one... Nurse: I don’t care if he is your fiancé. Sandy: Fiancée! 
Carol: Kind of a restaurant that serves drinks.Jason: A bar? 

Carol: that’s it. Jason: Were you drinking? Carol: Yes. Maggie: Was Sandy? Carol: Yes. And driving. Maggie: Carol, we have talked about this. Carol: Mum. Jason: I don’t believe what I’m hearing Carol. I mean I thought you had more sense than to get into a car with a guy like that. Carol: I do. Jason: Well it doesn’t sound like that to me. Carol: Well dad. You don’t have to get mad. We know it was wrong. We've learned our lesson. Sandy's got a second chance now and he's never going to do it again.

That guy Dugg just called from the hospital.Carol: Uh hu.Mike: Well he told me that uh, he said that,, Jason: What is it Mike?

Maggie: Honey. Carol: No! Mike: Hey the doctors said that he or something. Internal hemorrhaging.Carol: Mum, this has to be some mistake. I mean Sandy's going to be fine. He told me. Maggie: Honey. Carol: This isn’t fair. What happened to his second chance? What happened to his second chance?

(Previously on growing pains) Jason: Yes it seems that your grandmother and, uh,Wally: Wally. Jason: Wally, have set a wedding date. Grandma: On a cruise to the Caribbean. 
Mike: Not a bad commute. Ben: Mike, listen to this.
Grandma: What’s this? Jason: Oh just a little something I had my lawyer whip up. It’s really very simple. Grandma: Standard prenuptial agreement!Jason: Yep, yep, yep, yep. It’s uh, and I think that as soon as you get over your initial reaction, you are going to see the wisdom..ah.

Ben: Mike, mike, mike, mike, mike, mike, mike. You will not believe this. Today is our lucky day. Mike: Why? What is it? Ben: Mike, there are twenty of the hottest babes in the world on this boat. Mike: So. 
Ben: We're talking Swedish, blonde, gymnasts. Mike: Hey, there is much more to a woman than the way she looks. Alright. I mean you got to take into account all kinds of things like her personality and her intelligence and uh, and her uh,
Mike: This is the first time in my life I’ve been touched by eight female hands at the same time. Ben: Second for me. Mike: Well hello... Julie: Julie. Mike: Julie. That’s funny, I. Julie!

Jason: Hey, Maggie. What's with the chain? Maggie: Here. Pack your own things. Jason: What. Aren’t you over reacting just a little? 
Maggie: Hi. Grandma: Hi. Jason: Mum, ok, I know you're upset. But please, isn’t it better that this happened now rather 

than later? Grandma: Righty oh. This is going to be so much fun tonight, just us girls. Maggie: Oh I know.Jason: The healing process is already underway. Maggie: Jason. Why don’t we talk in the hall? Jason: Come on Maggie. I'm a reasonable man. I don’t know how I can say it any clearer than that. A man who knows he's right doesn’t mind where he sleeps. Hey Wally. Wally: Jason, when I was in the army, I was on the boxing team. Jason: I didn’t know that. Wally: Yeah. And I always felt better after a fight, because I was able to get whatever ailed me out of my system through my fists. Jason: Well you know that’s not so unusual. A lot of my patients tell me that if only they had someone to..

Jason: Wait a second. We should just be a little adult about this. Ben, where have you been? How are you? Ben: Fine, but I have to go to the bathroom. Jason: Hey, you don’t have a second to talk to your old dad? What have you been up to? 
Mike: Hi. Julie: I'm in no mood for your charm. Mike: Look Julie. Julie look. You should know that the only reason I was with those beautiful women is because they remind me of you. I figured I’d try and open with a joke. Julie: You would.
Carol: My dad doesn’t know about you and Mike. 

Julie: But he just asked me about our breakup on the hall. Carol: Julie, the only breakup I know about is grandma and Wally's. Julie: Oh. Carol: What break up were you talking about? Oh. Julie: I'm glad this is over with. He can be so selfish and immature. Carol: Well that's probably because he was confused. I mean he's never been in love before.Julie: What makes you think he's in love? Carol: Same thing that makes you think he is.

Jason: Mike. What are you doing up? Mike: Oh uh, just taking a walk. Jason: Yeah, me too. Been kind of a rough evening. Mike: Yeah, what happened? Some woman misunderstood something you said and blew up at you? Jason: Actually yes. You were downstairs? You heard your mum and I talking?Mike: No. Dad, nice night. Jason: What’s the matter? Mike: Nothing.Jason: Come on Mike. I'm your father. Hey, what’s going on?Mike: Look, I can’t tell you. I wish I could but I can’t. I'll see you later dad. Thanks. Jason: Ok fine fine. You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. I respect your privacy. Mike: Dad, I really need to talk to you.Jason: What? What is it? Mike: Well see dad, I've been going out with this girl for quite a while. Jason: Ah! Mike: But it’s over now. Jason: Oh! Who is she? Mike: Julie. 
Jason: I knew that. So why do you want to keep this such a big secret? Mike: Well, you know. With Julie working for you and mum, and she thought that if you found out about me and her,... I never got it myself. All I know is that going out with Julie has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don’t just like her. I like me when I’m with her. 

You know and dad, I don’t want this to end. Jason: Well you know the pressure to keep this thing a secret has got to create a big strain on you. Mike: Well actually it was kind of fun sneaking around.Jason: Come on. Wouldn’t it have been a lot more fun f you'd have had my blessing?Mike: Nah! Jason: Mike, come on. Whether you realize it or not, the subconscious desire for approval between a parent and a child is crucial. A child really needs a parent’s approval; a parent even needs a child’s approval. That’s why. I've been a boob. Mike: All I understood was the last point.Jason: I can’t believe..what have I done? Physician heal myself.Mike: Wait a minute. I'm not a physician. I need more help than that. Jason: Well I’m talking about my problem.

Mike: What about my problem? Jason: You just do what men have always done. You get down on your knees and you beg for forgiveness for whatever it is she thinks you've done wrong, cos you probably done it. And if you didn’t do it then it doesn’t matter anyway cos as long as you are in love, you are never going to get a fair shake. Mike: That’s your great advice? Jason: Mike, you're old enough to finally be told. The things you enjoy the most in life...make no sense whatsoever.Mike: Wait a minute. Where are you going?Jason: I've got to go and get gran and Wally back together. Mike: What they broke up? But they are supposed to be getting married tomorrow morning! This makes no sense to me whatsoever. Jason: You're leaning. Mike: What? What am I learning?
Maggie: Jason, I was just agreeing with you. Grandma: Jason, even when you were little, you could drive your father and me up the wall.Jason: Yes. And if I can do that with two people who love me, imaging how crazy I’m driving poor Wally. Grandma: Oh, I’m sure he doesn’t even want to see me.; Jason: Well then mum, don’t give him a choice.

Wally: Prenuptial agreement. What’s the matter with a guy like that? Here I make a fool of myself .. Grandma: Wally! Wally: Urma what are you doing out there? You're going to kill yourself.Grandma: We've got to talk. Wally: What?Grandma: we have got o talk. Wally: Oh, well, wh wh wh wh... Grandma: We are not off to a very good start dear.Wally: Oh Urma. I acted like a chump tonight. I am so sorry.Grandma: No Wally, you were right. Wally: I was right? Grandma: Yes, it is about you and me and our life together. I should have told you then.

Wally: Then I didn’t act like a chump? Grandma: Of course dear, but it was not your fault. Jason was the real chump and he knows that but he's given us his blessing.

Maggie: That's it? That's your answer? Huh! The wedding's off, let's eat! Julie: Mike meant, because we're in love now. Mike: yeah, Dad, we love each other! Jason: Well, I deal with what real love is in the corollary to question thirty eight there. So we can just move on for now. Let's go to question two, "where will you live?"

Mike: Oh, can I have another copy? I got wiener juice on my forty three! Maggie: Here, take mine! This is getting us absolutely nowhere!Jason: Maggie, we agreed we wouldn't yell at them, remember? Maggie: Jason, between tabling, corollaries ananananan wiener juice we've covered absolutely nothing!!! 
Jason: Oh, good, so what do you want me to do? You want me to just give up my calm rational approach? Should I just blurt out, they are about to make the biggest mistake of their lives!!!!???? Mike: The biggest mistake of our lives? Jason: Oh, come on, Mike, you know it's true! I mean you get all swept up in a little forbidden romance and before you know it, ba-bing! ba-bang! ba-boom! Wow!

Maggie: Stop! Stop it! Jason: Maggie, Come on! Now, under normal circumstances I would applaud you telling your parents to hit the road. Heck, I'd do the wave! But, I think tonight, you have strayed from your original purpose. Maggie: You're right! Let's find her and fire her! Jason: No!! Maggie, no! Look, come on, whatever happened to the calm, rational discussion? Whatever happened to the little chat over dinner? What happened to dinner? Maggie: Well I...I figured she'd never make it past the pate. Look, I don't feel so great about what I just did. But I am worried to death about Mike. He's this sweet kid, who's nowhere near ready for the trials and tribulations of marriage. Jason: Hey, I know that. Maggie: Jason, do remember how tough our first year together was? Remember the pain? We almost didn't make it. I just love him so much, I don't wanna see him hurt. Jason: Nor do I honey, that's... Maggie: But you don't think he should go ahead and... Jason: No, no, not at all. No, but I do think those two should hear what you just said to me. 
Maggie: You're right. Grandpa: Alright! Now freeze!! 
Grandpa: If I have to!! But, enough of this malarkey! I think the four of you should be 

Jason: Oh. Grandma: This is all so funny. Ha ha ha. You are reacting to Mike's fiancée, just as I reacted to Jason. 

Maggie: Ha! Did I ever call Julie a hippy sleaze ball, who wanted to be some second-rate rock star?!! Have I ever said to Mike, "until you regain your senses, we will do the thinking for you! Young man, it's time to nip this thing in the bud!!" Jason? Jason: Did you ever hear that demo I cut with the new bass player? Maggie: No, I haven't! Because I would never talk that way to my son!

Grandpa: Mike, just between the two of us; you don't marry girls like this. Julie: Gals like this!! Mike: Hey, listen Grandpa, as much as I love you, you say another word and I'm gonna have to hit you!! 

Jason: Well, look the whole issue here Mike, is really one of timing. I mean why do you wanna get married in three months? Why not wait a year? Why do you wanna jump into this thing? Mike: See, there you go again Dad, just jump into this thing. I am not jumping, OK? Do you see anyone in this room who is jumping? We're all sitting! Jason: Mike.

Maggie: Oh Jason, don't you have a tissue? For me. Mike: I thought you guys said that Julie and I were rushing into this. Julie: Where'd you get an idea like that? Priest: Dearly beloved... Mike: I do.Priest: ...we are gathered together today, to witness the marriage of Julie Lin Costello and Michael Aaron Seaver. Boner: Yeah!!! Priest: Marriage is an honourable state, and as such, should not be entered into lightly, so, if anyone has just cause why this couple should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace. Congregation: I do!! I do!! Priest: Tough room. I'm sure these God fearing people would dummy up if you'd give them one good reason why you two are getting married. Congregation: (shouting in protest to the wedding) Julie: Well yeah, I'm curious too. Mike: Ah...well...err... 
Julie: Mike! Mike: Err...err... (Mike wakes up from his dream) I love you! I love you! Carol: Ha! You disgust me! 
Carol: This is the thanks I get for addressing two hundred stinking wedding invitations. Mike: Look Carol, I said I was sorry, alright? Carol: Ha!

don't know why, I had this wild dream about me and Julie. Carol: Mike, please, I just lived that disgusting dream; I don't need to hear about it.Mike: Wait a minute, Carol. These invitations are all wrong. Carol: That's what Mom and Dad have been saying for months.Mike: Oh, no, no, no. Look, right here-"as Julie and Mike celebrate the beginning of their life together." It should be-"lives together." Hey, I mean, I got that wrong on an English paper. Carol: Mike, I applaud your flash of literacy, but you're missing the point. You and Julie are starting "a" life together...one life, get it? Mike: Yeah, so which one of us is losing our life? 

Maggie: Wow, you got all the invitations done. Mike: Mom, look, I am not in the mood to hear, one more time, all of your sensible reasons why Julie and I should wait. Maggie: So, you admit, they're sensible reasons? Mike: Mom, you're missing the key idea here. Maggie: Mike, I'm sorry, you're right. Like I promised last week, and several times before that, no more negativity. From this day forward, I'll embrace your marriage with gusto. Mike: Mom, you make it sound like a beer commercial. 
Maggie: Yes I do.

Maggie: Honey, you don't have to go through all that again; I know how you feel, because twenty years ago, I was you. Your dad was Julie, my mom was me, Grandpa Ed was... Gosh, 
Mike: No, Mom, Mom, keep going. You were real near making a point...weren't ya? Maggie: Yes. Mike, you're not getting married to please us; you're getting married because this is something you want to do, and you know all the reasons why. Mike: I do. 
Maggie: But if you have any doubts, don't be too... Mike: I have none! I have none! I'm very confident and extremely happy! Maggie: And I'm bubbling for you. Mike, honey, don't forget your stinking invitations. "Stinking" was wrong. 
Mike: Hey Dad, you know sometimes Mom makes me nuts. Jason: Hey, I never said this, OK? Tell me about it. Mike: Yeah, I mean, when is she finally gonna understand that I am a capable, mature adult,

Jason: Mike, I know what's upsetting your Mom. Mike: Dad, look, I did not ask her for a Dime. Jason: No, but what day is this? Mike: Saturday. Jason: And what's under your arm? Mike: Hair. 
Jason: Well thank you. OK. Well let's go over the reasons. Mike: Oh, right, well I love her. And...and...and....err all the same reasons why you married Mom. Jason: Oh, Mike, Mike, I...I just couldn't imagine spending another day without her. I mean from the moment that I proposed, right up until this instant Mike, I've never had any doubt 

that your mother was the only one for me. Mike: Never a doubt? Not one? This is Mom we're talking about. Jason: Ah, come on! I had cold feet, just like you're having now, and don't you deny it. But that's...err...not the same as doubt, Mike, that's normal...it's required. Mike: Really?Jason: Mmm. Mike: Well then, what did you do to get over the cold feet? Jason: Oh, it's a little different for everybody. I think for me it was a song-"Is it in her face?

Carol: Well, could you pretend like we've been out a few times before? Like we're going steady. Big Al: Sure, no problem. I've been telling mother, you're my woman for weeks.

Mike: See, that's what I've been trying to tell you, all the way down here. Laura-Lynn: Your brother, Mike, is so cute. Do you think there's a chance that you'll wind up looking like him?Ben: Any chance you're gonna end up looking like your mother?Grandma: Maggie! Maggie: Hi Urma. Grandma: Hi sweet heart.

Grandma: Is who here? Maggie: Oh, the guy Carol's been dating, whose name we don't even know yet. Jason: Well, I know why she's been hiding him from us too; he's probably some muscle-bound beach bum in a torn t-shirt. Grandma: Oh come on! Carol! Jason: Oh come on mother! Women always say they want somebody sensitive and intelligent, and then you end up picking some guy with bulging biceps and raw animal passion. Maggie: I didn't. Mike: Hey, Dad...Dad this is Kate. Maggie: Hi Kate. Maggie. Kate: Hi. Jason: Jason. Kate: Hi. Well, now I see where Mike gets his good looks. Jason: Oh thanks. Maggie: Oh thanks. Kate: Here, Urma, let me help you with that. Grandma: Oh, thank you.

Big Al: May I use the kitchen? Grandma: Oh it...it...it's right in there. Carol: I'll help, honey. Maggie: Honey! Ben: Wow, who's the old dude? Maggie: Jason, do something. Jason: I don't know what to say. Maggie: Well, that's never stopped you before.

Carol: Oh you are so funny! You're doing great. Big Al: Then why are they all staring at me?Carol: Well, they've never met a man who makes his own pork products. Maggie: Maybe this is Carol's way of reacting to all the pressure you've put on her. Carol: Oh honey, come one, I just wanted to meet the guy. I didn't know she was gonna show up with Oscar Myer. Mike, what do you know about this guy she's seeing?Mike: He smokes his own meat. Big Al: Well winged in. Grandma: Oh thank you, Al. Big Al: Urma, please. Grandma: Oh sorry...Big Al! 
Jason: Don't you take another step, young lady. Carol: Daddy, I will not have you stand here and insult my honey man. 

Big Al: Well, I had a lovely, lovely evening. And I think in time, your parents will be able to see past the age difference and accept me. Carol: Big Al, you do realise that tonight was a pretend date? Big Al: Sure. Sure! I just wanna pretend a little longer. Carol: I had a lovely evening tonight, Big. Big Al: Is it alright if I pretend right up until I get into my car? Carol: What the heck. Why don't you pretent all the way home.

Oh, and listen, Carol...errm...I gotta ask you, where in the heck did you get that guy? Carol: You didn't like him? Mike: Oh, no, he was fine. He was actually better than I thought you could get. Ben: Oh yeah! Well I lied! I had a lousy time and you already look like your mother!! I'm never gonna pick a blonde for anything! Mike: OK, Carol, what's the real story? Carol: Real story! I happened to have found someone, mature and wonderful... 

Mike: Oh, well, that's Mom and Dad and listen...good luck, and I would not mention Rob Lowe to Mom and Dad in your opening remarks.Maggie: Carol honey, let's talk. Carol: Mom, Dad, I'll save you some time! Big Al and I have not been dating. Jason: Yeah, we figured that out! Carol: You what? Maggie: Figured it out. It was pretty obvious that you brought Al tonight to make a point. Carol: Well, I certainly did, and I'm glad you finally realised that. Good night.

Jason: Well...wa...wa...wait. Wow wow. You think that says it all, Carol? Carol: Well, if it'll make you feel better to apologise...go ahead. Jason: Well alright. Maybe I should apologise, because these past few months, Carol, I've been wanting very badly to believe that you're OK. And I didn't realise the truth, until tonight.Carol: What truth? What are you talking about? Maggie: We're talking about Sandy, and what happened to him. Carol: He died, Mom! He died! You can say it! I'm over it. But tonight had nothing to do with Sandy! Jason: Hey! It has everything to do with Sandy. Carol: Dad, please. Maggie: Let him talk. Jason: Why haven't you dated?

I know you're in her Mike. Mike, I'm gonna count to three, and if you're not out I'm gonna...slit your water bed Mike! Mylene: Hi, I'm looking for... Oh oh. Jason: I'm looking for him too.

How did I know, Funky had a big mouth? 

Jason: His name is Funky?Ben: Yeah and the...and the one to Louis, well that was the first one I ever sold...and it would have stopped there if it wasn't for Mike. Jason: Mike! Mike: I'm flossing.

Principle: Oh, I'm not suggesting anything of the kind... Jason: Well what exactly are you... Principle: Well just listen. From Louis Dibble for Senior History, "The French Revolution and Excercise in Rudeness."Carol: I wrote that! Principle: Precisely. Or, from Joey Biden, for Health, "Cosmetic History, Just Say Nose."

You sold them to people who shouldn't have had them, and you made a date with an eighteen year old girl! Ben: Actually, she made the date with me. Jason: I don't care. And you skipped classes at your own school, did you even think about that? Ben: Well, actually I was gonna forge an excuse... I am an idiot. Jason: And Mike, you helped him try and pull this whole thing off.Mike: And I admitted it, like a man. Jason: Yeah, when you had no other way to go. Mike: There is that, yes. 
Carol: That's all he got! That's all my high school years are worth! 


Principle: Carol, wise up, you went to Public school. Jason: Mr. Dewitt, even though Ben and Mike don't attend Dewey High, I assure you they will be punished severely. Principle: I appreciate that. And while Mike is certainly out of my reach, I just thank God that I had to work out that Extradition agreement with Ben's Junior High school. Maggie: So, if you two gentlemen will excuse us, your father and I have some major...major punishments to discuss. Oh, and Mike, sometimes the one who set the example pays a higher price than the one who followed it.

Jason: Well, you know, I was gonna tell you about her...and this wasn't one of those male deals where I'm proud of the little horn ball for getting an eighteen year old to ask him out. Maggie: Oh, it wasn't! Jason: No, but I was under the gun Maggie; I only had time to discuss the important things.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Patient: All I'm saying is, that if my wife, the woman that I cherish, thinks getting a job is more important than our marriage, let her die. Jason: Mr. Lapepki, think for just a moment, isn't this woman the same person you married ten years ago. Patient: No, she's fat. Jason: But does she not also have a right to her own professional fulfillment? Patient: Wow, you're whipped! Jason: Mr. Lapepki, let me share with you a personal anecdote, if I may; I was in a similar situation about four years ago. Patient: Ah, right, your wife was putting on the pounds too, huh? Jason: No. No, but after fifteen years as a home-maker, she suddenly decided to resume her career, I couldn't believe it! I mean, I certainly didn't want to give up everything I'd worked for and come home! I mean, after all the patients that you deal with at a home practice, frankly aren't always that inter... Ah, with the exception of you. So, I had a decision to make; what came first, my career or my marriage... I came home. And quite frankly, Mr. Lapepki, I couldn't be happier. Now, does that sound whipped, to you? Patient: You can put it on pumpkin pie! Jason: Alright, well that's our session for today. I'll be remodeling this office, so next week will be at another address. Patient: Oh, a real office, huh? Jason: This is a real office Mr. Lapepki, I do real work here. Patient: I didn't mean to insult you. I welcome the change. Psychiatrists with real offices are so much more...interesting. Maggie: Jason, I'm home! Patient: She could whip me anytime. Carol: Ben, my pancakes are cold. Ben: So, sit on 'em. Mike: Ben, what are these little black things in my pancakes? Ben: The ones without legs are rasinettes. Carol: You are never gonna cook breakfast again! Ben: That's my plan. Mike: Benny look, you are only seeing the downside of Dad going to work here. Now, there is an upside too. OK, with Mom at work and Dad safely out of the way all week, when you get home from school today... Jason: You will behave exactly as if I was watching your every move.Mike: Isn't that crazy, the man read my mind. Jason: Yeah.Maggie: I bought extra diapers, Chrissy isn't used to day care.

Jason: Where is that contract? I should have left five minutes ago. There's all that traffic and then the toll, oh! Maggie, I'm gonna need exact change for the toll. Mike: Allow me Dad. Ben, give the man a Buck.Jason: Maggie, come on, you said you'd get me some extra diapers for Chrissy. Maggie: I did, Jason. You're nervous. Jason: Well, I'm not who's comfortable with change. Ben: Then give me my quarters back. Jason: You know everything I need is right here at home; I don't need to commute, and I don't have any interruptions... Ben: And you get to watch Operah. Everybody knows, Dad. Maggie: And all these years I thought you were doing me a big favour by working at home. Jason: Well, I'm not the kind of guy to bring it up, but I am! Oh finally! Ben: Yep. 

Jason: Can you believe, three thousand Dollars for textured walls! Maggie: Sure, now that I'm being offered good articles to write, I'm too busy to take them! Jason: And now that I bothered with medical school, I find out the big Bucks are in contracting! Oh Chrissy, I'm sorry, Daddy wouldn't leave without ya! 
Jason: Don't cry, baby. Bye bye baby!! Goo goo! Kevin: You're a little early, the doctor’s not in yet. Jason: Oh, yes he is. Kevin: Sure he is. Jason: Oh, I'm Jason Seaver, I'm gonna be in Dr. Bigman's office this... Kevin: Right, we were expecting you. I'm Kevin Randall. Jason: Hi. Oh, I was just putting my daughter in day care. So, what's your area of expertise? Kevin: Filing, typing, steno.

Jason: Oh, you treat secretaries? Kevin: I am a secretary. In fact, I'm yours. Jason: Ah, a male secretary! That's kind of strangely...fascinating, as an idea, yes. Well, err...I'll be in my office, which is where? Paul: Jason Seaver, you son of a gun! Jason: Hey Paul! Paul: How long's it been? Jason: About a week. You had dinner at my place, remember? Paul: Oh, then why am I hugging you? Jason: Well, I don't know, you always do that when you see me; it's starting to get on my nerves. Paul: Have you seen your office? Jason: No. Paul: Then let me show you. Jason: Wow. Paul: Yeah. Alright! Jason: A male secretary?! Paul: Come on! Where have you been, Jase? 

Thelma: Nice alliteration. Maggie: So, this is the day, I take a stand. Mr. Sedlovich, I am a darn good reporter, and I have worked very hard to show you that, but it's not easy when the biggest story I have done in months is, "Gingivitis, are your gums trying to tell you something!" Boss: I have failed to make use of your journalistic talent. I accept full responsibility, as of today, I'm out of here. Maggie: Well, I didn't mean that you had to quit! Boss: I didn't quit, I'm fired! Maggie: You're kidding! Boss: No. I'm fired. If I were kidding, I would not be packing all of my worldly possessions into this incredibly smelly box. Do you want my happy feet? Maggie: Oh, Mr. Sedlovich, how can they do this to you?Boss: Station manager's unhappy with our image, so we hired a media consulted. He

consulted. I'm gone.Maggie: But that is so unfair. Well, what if we're all gone? Boss: Oh, I don't think you have to worry, Maggie, I said some very nice things about you. Of course, I said some very nice things about me too, and look what happened. Well, I guess that's about it. Maggie: Mr. Sedlovich, if there's anything I can do, let me know. I mean it...anything. Boss: You know, I might take a shot at print journalism again. That guy from Esquire that keeps calling you, what's his number? Maggie: Oh, it's five six five it's... Wait a second, I... Mr. Sedlovich, I may need that number... Boss: Bye Maggie. Maggie: Bye Sid. Boss: Bye office. No number, no feet. 
Mike: Oh great Mom, you're home! Maggie: Oh you are... 

anyway, why not put in...I don't know...a whole wall of Japanese screens. You know, maybe do the rest of the room in some blue/grey tones, huh? Frank: I think I should have charged you by the hour. Jason: Yeah. Well, I gotta run...my colleagues are expecting me. Well I guess I can't put it off any longer, I better get into the office. Maggie: Oh, honey, you don't have to fake being down for me, I'm fine. Jason: You sure? Maggie: Yeah, what can I do? It's out of my hands. Jason: Well, that's a very good attitude. Maggie: But, if what I think is going to happen to me happens, and you have another great day...fake your little heart. 
Maggie: They won't fire Dr. Claus, he's being doing the weather for ever. Dr. Claus, not you

too! Dr. Claus: Auf wiedersein. Maggie: Well if that's the way they're going to be, I don't care if they fire me. Colleague: Oh God, I hope they don't fire me.
Patient: So, I thought maybe I was wrong about my wife wanting to work. Jason: Then, we're making progress. Patient: I took your advice. I told her, you don't wanna be at home anymore, fine. Jason: Bravo. Patient: Haven't seen her for three days. Jason: I'm very sorry. Patient: I'm not. I'm just waiting for the day she comes waddling home, with her tale between her legs. Excuse me, Dr. Seaver, is that your chair ringing? 
Paul: Oh wait a second, I promise I'll never hug you again.


Jason: No, Paul I have a deal with Maggie. We have always believed that one of us should be there for the kids at all times. It's her time for career opportunities, not mine! Paul: Oh, come on, give me a break, Jase. I mean look, you can make a lot of money here, and that's important for your family too. And besides, you're the man of the house, what you say goes, right?Jason: Well that's a very sexist thing to say...agreeable, but sexist.Paul: Think Jase, this office can be yours, permanently. Yes, even the chair. Jason: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you...I can't. No, I'm happy at home Paul.Paul: Wait a second, you're happy? Jason: I'm happy, I'm happy, ha ha ha ha! Paul: Jase, are you sure you're not blocking or displacing or repressing... Jason: Yes. Paul: Yes, you're repressing.

Paul: Yeah, you just won't admit it!! Jason: Am not! Am not! Am not! Am not! Paul: Jason is blocking, blocking, blocking, blocking! 
Ben: Hey, Mike check this out! Mike: What the heck is that? 

Jason: I didn't think so. Let me ask you this; do you think that a man should be boss, do you think what a man says goes? Frank: Well, that's a pretty sexist thing to say...agreeable but sexist. Jason: Well, I don't feel that way. I feel that if Maggie's happy at her job...and by the way, I'm not so sure Maggie is all that happy at her job. In fact that may not even be her job any more, if they decided who they're gonna fire! Ho ho, wouldn't that be something if Maggie got canned!!! No, no, I didn't mean that.Maggie: Hello, Jason, anybody home?Jason: Oh, hi honey. Maggie: Hi honey, how was your day?

Jason: Alright, well, that's our session for today. I'll be remodeling this office, so next week we'll be at another address, OK? Patient: A real office, huh? Jason: This is a real office Mr. Lapepki, I do real work here. 
Jason: Now, I'm not saying we have to have beamed ceilings, but let's not be afraid of spruce Frank: You know what, why don't we just go take a look at your office? Jason: Yes. Mike: Carol, do I detect a sudden interest in contracting? Carol: Just because I look at a good-looking guy with a nice chest of power tools, doesn't mean I'm ready to have his child! 
Paul: Jason Seaver!! Jason: Paul. Paul: You son of a gun! How long's it been? Jason: About a week. You had dinner at my place, remember? Paul: Oh! Then why am I hugging you?Jason: I don't know. You always do that when you see me; you're starting to get on my nerves. Paul: Have you seen your office? Jason: No. Paul: Oh, let me show you. Jason: I really have to thank you and Phil for letting me use this office. Paul: Hey jees, hey please, don't mention Phil, huh. He's off at a Zurich conference, and I'm stuck here with a double patient load. 
Jason: Oh, well, at least you're not bitter about it.

Maggie: He has got to be kidding. Thelma have you seen this assignment sheet? Thelma: No. Maggie: Thelma, you typed it.Thelma: Well yeah, but I didn't read it. That way I don't get involved.Maggie: I'm supposed to do a feature entitled, "Winterizing your Dog." So rather than writing an insightful, respectable, journalistic piece for Esquire Magazine, I'll be showing people how to put snow tyres on their Shiatsus.Thelma: Nice alliteration. Maggie: So this is the day, I take my stand.Maggie’s Boss: I have failed to make use of your journalistic talent! I accept full responsibility! As of today, I'm out of here.

Maggie: You certainly seem to have had a good day! Jason: Good, doesn't begin to describe it, Maggie; I had a great day! I had the most fabulous office, the people down there are terrific, and two doctors...count 'em...two doctors consulted me on their cases. I have never been so excited. How was your day? Maggie: My boss was fired, and I may be next. Paul: How would you like to take over for Phil here? Jason: Well, it's a very unexpected offer! A very attractive offer! Maybe we could do something finally about that free clinic idea, we talked about at lunch. Paul: Absolutely! 
Mike: Alright, now if...if you are gonna have this party, and if this is gonna be full of frisky little horn bowls...and if! You do not want Mom and Dad finding out about this thing... 

Ben: Mike, stop saying, if! I'm having the stinking party! Mike: Come on Benny, give me some diability here. Mike and Ben: Morning Dad! Jason: Only coffee! Come on, whose turn to make breakfast?Mike: Ah...Carol's. Jason: Fine, fine, I'll whip something up myself. Comes with the territory when you're the parent who works at home. Maggie: Good morning. Jason: Morning. Maggie: See you guys later. Mike: See you, Mom.Jason: Not having breakfast! Maggie: Oh honey, I can't stay. Dick and Steve said they wanted to talk to me first thing about

some of the changes they have in store for their new star reporter. Ooh, that's what they called me. Oh honey, I still can't believe all this is happening. Jason: Neither can I.
Carol: Frank... Frank: Yeah. Carol: May I touch your drill? Jason: Carol! Carol: Dad, can't you knock? Jason: I just want you to know, that it did not go unnoticed that it was your turn to make breakfast, OK? Carol: But it was Mike's turn, remember? Jason: Oh, as long as I'm here Carol, let me remind you that the reason that Frank is here this 

Maggie: No I didn't... Dick: Well you're getting the director who shot that! Maggie: Really? Steve: Maggie, you can put this in the bank. Channel Nineteen is going to be spending its resources on solid, hard news. No more mini cam crews, and investigative stories, no more flashy sets and hairdressers. Dick: Sound good? Maggie: Oh boy, it sure does. Oh, but I would still get to have a...hair person, right?
Jason: ...in direct, the core of Mr. Mitchell's problem is his inability to tell his wife, how he really feels. Ha, must be contagious!Jason and Kevin: Strike that last word! Kevin: I'll have these notes, typed and on your desk before lunch.

Kevin: Her file's under your elbow.Jason: I'm think of a number between one and ten, Kevin; do you know what it is?Kevin: Three. Jason: Amazing. Three, yeah; the number of days left before I say, goodbye office.Paul: Hey Jase. Jason: Hi Paul. Paul: I just got to apologise to you for giving you a hard time the other day. I was being selfish, because quite frankly I just wanted you to work here so bad. But hey listen, you made this deal with Maggie, and you should honour it, OK? I'm sorry.Jason: That's it? You're not going to try to talk me into staying again?Paul: Sorry? 

Girl: Your name is Stinky? It fits! Ben: Dad, let me explain how Mike got me into this. Jason: Hey, I want you to go up to your room and don't you come down until you can shave. Ben: Shave what? Jason: I don't care! Now I sure don't need these anymore. I can't believe... My one chance to turn this whole deal thing around and I'm foolish enough to count on you kids to help! Mike, where are you going? Mike: We...well I was gonna put these in water for you, Dad. Jason: Carol, what was going on in there that you couldn't hear what was happening out here? Carol: Dad, I don't like what you're implying. Jason: Stop! Carol: What? Jason: What is on your backside?

Well, I was just talking to him and standing like this.Mike: God Carol, and Dad was worried you were hot for the guy. Jason: Maybe it's time I had a worried with Frank... Maybe more than a word. Carol: Dad, please! Jason: And another thing, you're fired! 
Maggie: Chrissy's upstairs, ready to go. Where are the other kids? Jason: Well, Ben just blew through here like a shot, Carol mumbled something about breakfast at work, and Mike...hey who's seen him? Maggie: I can't say I blame them. You were pretty rough on them last night. Jason: Well, do you think I over-reacted? Maggie: I didn't say, over-reacted. Jason: No, but you think that, don't you? Mmm? 
Producer: OK, we are rolling and...queue her! 


Maggie: Jason, honey, can I freshen that up for you? Jason 2: Sure, Maggs. Maggie: I just can't do it.Dick: Oh, why? Maggie: I can't call him Jason. I am a journalist, I can't say things that aren't true. Steve: Maggs, babe, I thought we went through all this. Dick: Maggie, I am in the image business; now I would never tell you how to do a news story because I'm not a news guy; but please, let me do my job here.Steve: Let's get some viewers watch you do the news, by making a great promo here. What do you say? Jason 2: Hey, I'm game. Producer: Still rolling.Maggie: Honey.

can't. Thelma: Oh, sure you can. Take those free-lance writing assignments I always hear you turning down. Maggie: No, I'd love to, but I can't. Thelma: You said you wanted to be home for your baby, here's your chance. Maggie: No, it's not.Thelma: Why not? Maggie: Because we can't afford to have both of us working at home. Thelma: Well couldn't Jason... Maggie: No. No, Jason and I have a deal and he loves having his practice there and I just can't mess that up. Thelma: Well how do you know he loves working at home?

Mike: Hey, hey, you took the words right out of my mouth. Philly: Here you go. Mike: Alright. Thanks. Philly: Don't exhume just yet. Mike: Hey, how could I? I haven't had my coffee. Wait a minute, Philly, I thought I was only supposed to deliver two hundred papers. Philly: Exactamundo. Mike: Ah, but...ah...Philly, two hundred papers didn't look like this, all last week. Philly: Sunday edition, Michael. Mike: Really? Philly: You think that it's merely capricious that we initiate paper carriers on Monday? Nay, nay! 
Jason: Mike. Mike: Hey, Dad. Jason: You got a job! You didn't tell us. Mike: Dad, I mean, every time I tell you that I've done something responsible, you always give me that look, and you get so excited and you say, that's my boy! I'm just trying to avoid that. Jason: Done! Where's my stinking paper been all week?Mike: It's right up in my place, Dad; it's the first one that I deliver!

Jason: Yeah, well those are my papers, you owe my two Dollars. Mike: What, no interest? Jason: That hurts, Mike that really hurts.Mike: Dad, I... Jason: I know! I know! You got papers to deliver! You got a job! Ow! Go! Go! That's my boy! Hey, where's my stinking paper? 
Mike: Oh, I am exhausted! Guess how many papers I delivered today? Carol: One. Mike: No, two hundred! Two O O! And we're talking Sunday papers here, Carol. We're talking huge, mountainous, heavy papers. This is the hardest fifty Bucks I've ever made! You know, I think I was tricked. Fifty Dollars a day is fine when there's no news, but what's with these world leaders? I mean...why do these world leaders wait until the weekend to spout off? 
Carol: Mike, it might look like I'm leaving the room right now because I don't care to listen to your self-pitying babble; but that's not the case! I'm just so moved by your sad story that I have to go to another room and weep. Mike: Thanks a lot, Carol.Carol: Mike, I'm not a fool! I know what you're thinking. Mike: You do? Carol: Alright, first the sad story, then the mention of fifty Dollars I couldn't miss it, and then coup de grace, your admission that you couldn't handle the job. Mike: So, what do I think this means?Carol: Isn't it obvious? 
Carol: You want me to take over your paper round! And pay me a measly fifty dollars a day while you keep the rest of what you're really paid. Well it won't work, deliver your own stinking papers, all two O O of them. Mike: Well you're nuts, Carol! Really nuts! It never occurred to me to skim off the top. But now that it does... Carol: When one runs a scam, Mike, one should pray on one dumber than oneself, if one can find one. Ben: Morning Mike. Mike: Hey, morning Ben. Ben. Hey, hey, hey, how is one? I mean...err...how are you this morning? Ben: Ha? 
Ben: What? Mike: You're thinking that with this paper round thing, they're practically giving money away! 
Ben: Na, actually I was thinking of Laura-Lynn in a bikini. Mike: And wouldn't she be impressed with a guy who's pulling down twenty five Bucks a day?
Mike: Ben! Benny, come on, you're not listening to me; I am offering you half of my paper route! 
Mike: Yes. 

Ben: And you're giving me half of it? Mike: Yes, a mere two hundred papers, and that's twenty five Bucks a day. Ben: Hey, this is great! Mike: Oh oh, wait a second, Ben; Mom and Dad are never gonna let you have a job at your age. Ben: Well, I won't tell 'em. Oh, come on, Mike, be a pal and don't tell either. Mike: Well, OK. But remember, you owe me. 
Mike: See ya. Ben: Twenty five Bucks a day, it aint worth it! Gary: Hey Benny, how's it going? Ben: It's not going anywhere until it dries out. Gary: You're gonna be late for school.

Ben: Gary, you don't have any idea what it's like to be a paper boy, do you? Gary: Ride a bike, throw a few papers, make big Bucks. Ben: Ha. But you get wet. Gary: Hey, if you don't want to do it, I'd do it. I mean what's it pay? Five Bucks? Ten Bucks?Ben: Ten Bucks! I get...ten Bucks. OK, Gary, you can have my paper route. Gary: Wait a minute, why are you giving up all this money? Ben: Ah, it's kind of personal. Gary: Really? Ben: Medical reasons. Well from riding my bike so much, I got paper boy's crotch. Ooh... All the money in the world isn't worth anything, if you have to walk like this. So we got a deal? Gary: Yeah! Let's not shake on it. Ben: Don't worry, I hear it too.

Gary: Hey, you're walking better. Ben: Than what? Oh, oh, well, right, I switched to boxer shorts. Gary: Wait a minute! This is work! 
Mike: How are you Philly? Philly: Despondent. Mike: Huh? Philly: Over your performance...or the lack of there in of.Mike: Wait, I still don't... Philly: Michael. While not delivering forty two papers may seem like a small transgression, let us suppose, you and I that one of your subscribers, thus denied, is a man this close to solving the essential questions which we wrestle with as enlightened beings. Mike: What forty two papers?

Philly: The one's for which you will not receive remuneration. Mike: Wait, wait a minute! Would you talk English?Philly: Sure. You throw away forty two papers, you lose money. Do it again, you lose your job! 
Mike: Benny, we must talk!Ben: I must chew. Mike: I'm serious Benny. I just got reamed out there! Forty two people did not get their papers yesterday! Ben: Really? Mike: Yes, but you let me down! Ben: Well, how do you know they came from my half of the route? Mike: Your half? Benny, there's only been complaints from your half of the route! Benny look, what am I paying you fifty Dollars a day for? Ben: You're not, you're paying me twenty five. 
Jason: Well, it's time I told you the truth, Maggie; my new office was a lie. Every morning I get all dressed up and I go hide in the garage and wait until quitting time. Maggie: Aha? 

Jason: Ah, no, to tell you the truth I messed up and cured my four o' clock. Maggie: Mmm. Jason: Not really. He was as sick as ever. No, I just had some cancellations so I thought I'd come home and we could have a little quality time. Maggie: This isn't part of it, is it? Ben, what happened? Ben: Errm...I had a sloppy lunch. Jason: Hold it! Maggie: Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan... Stinky's Mom: Mrs. Seaver we have a problem... Stinky: I didn't fink on you, Ben, they found coleslaw in my underwear. Stinky's Dad: Bernard, your mother's talking! Jason: Mrs. Sullivan, what happened... Stinky’s mom: Because of Ben, our little boy was taken advantage of.

Maggie: Taken advantage of? Stinky’s dad: And covered in pudding! Stinky’s mom: All because of Ben's paper route. Jason: Impossible! Ben doesn't even have a paper route! Mike: Hey Mom, when's dinner? Jason: Mike has a paper route. Mike: Never mind. Maggie: Stick around. Stinky’s dad: All I know is, my son delivered two hundred papers for a Dollar a day! Mike: A Dollar! I was just making sure that I heard that right. Stinky’s dad: While Ben was keeping either nine Dollars, or twenty four Dollars for doing nothing! Jason: What's going on here, Mike? Mike: Ah...don't you mean, Ben, Dad?Jason: No, I mean, Mike! 
Maggie: Mike! Mike: Mom, we are talking about the free enterprise system, OK? I mean, I sold something, I 

kept a little profit for myself; I mean, is that wrong? Mom, I should be praised, not punished! I mean, I be Lee Iacocca’s parents don't ground him every time he moves a Chrysler. Jason: Mike! Mike: Dad, Dad, look, punish me if you want to, but all I did was participate in a system that makes me... heck I'll just say it...darn proud to be an American. Carol: It's Gary's parents on the phone. They wanna talk to you as soon as Ben's crotch heals. 
Carol: That's all Mike got? He has to do his own paper route from now on! Jason: That's all he got. Carol: What happened to justice? What happened to equity? What happened to my punishing, vindictive, petty parents? Maggie: Oh, we're still here.

Before you know it, one day you look back and a night like this is maybe, just maybe, the best night of your life. Didi: Willis, that isn't your cigar smoke is it? Mr. Dawitt: Did darling.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Kate: So, you're saying I'm wrong. Mike: No, no, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying that you know absolutely nothing about women. Kate: Mike, there's not a woman in the world who's gonna let you kiss her after you got her name wrong. Mike: Kara...Karen, I mean, they're so close. Kate: Her name was Joan. Mike: Where were you when I needed you? Kate: I was with David, the only man who knows less about women than you do. David: Hiya. Kate: Where have you been? You were supposed to meet me here for lunch. David: Cut me some slack here babe; as director of this play we're doing, I gotta get lights, I gotta get props, I gotta get costumes... Kate: But I ate alone. David: But for one it has got to be perfect. You know what a royal pain in the rrump Professor Thorn is. Mike: Err...David. David: Let me share with you an anecdote from Rralph Rrichardson... Professor Thorn: Mr. Home, I roll my R's far more Rrregally than that. Mike: Ow, Professor, you're spitting on me. Professor Thorn: I know. A principal role of the Director is observation, so watch it, Bob. David: Wow, maybe I should apologise. Kate: Oh just sit down, eat your sandwich, I'm used to it... Figures. Mike: Ah, come on, David is crazy about you. Kate: Yeah, what do you know about guys? Mike: Hey, I've been one for the last fifteen years. Kate: But you're nineteen. Mike: Interesting story. Ben: So Dad, did you just let me win, or are you getting old and slow? Jason: I let you win. Mike: Hey Dad, hey Ben. Oh, Dad, this is David and you remember Kate. Jason: Yeah. Mike: We're gonna be rehearsing after dinner, OK? Jason: Yeah, fine. David and Kate: Hi there. Ben: I'm...Ben. Mike: Like she cares. Jason: Alright. Ready to go again? Ben: Err...yeah sure.

Jason: Alright, what's the scores? Is that Kate waving to you? Yes!! 

(Mike, David and Kate rehearsing-Mike and Kate are acting.) David: The train whistle blows. Mike: It's time to make a choice, you can stay here in this town living other people's dreams, or you can take a chance with me? Kate: Jeff, I can't decide my whole life in a moment. Mike: Well a moment is all we got. Then kiss me goodbye, Jessica. David: Ah! Look, look, look, look! The play's just going great until this kiss here at the end. Mike, you're not kissing her goodbye, you're kissing her hello. I mean, after this moment, we're supposed to believe she falls in love with you. I mean, the way you kissed her, I think you're the kind of guy who owns a lot of cats. OK, from where we were. Mike: A moment's all we got. Then kiss me goodbye, Jessica. David: Yo, Mike, you...err...you err...like girls, right? Mike: Yes man, of course I like girls! David: OK, then what the heck's the problem here? Mike: Nothing...no.. Well she's your girlfriend. David: No she's not. Kate: Pardon me. 
(Mike's dream) Mike: Well a moment's all we got. Then kiss me goodbye, Jessica. Wait, wait, could you please turn the lights back up! Thank you. I've got kind of an announcement to make; see we weren't 

acting just now, and I want you all to know, heck, I want the whole world to know, that I love Kate McDonnell. And I think as you can tell from that last kiss, she feels the same way about me. Kate: Mike! Mike, we're just acting. Mike: What? Kate: Mike, we're just doing a play. Mike: You mean, you're not crazy about me? Kate: I don't even like you. Professor Thorn: I don't like you either and I'm a royal pain in the rump. Mike: Errm...folks...errm... What you have just seen here is proof that a kiss means nothing between actors. Here let me demonstrate. Dad!! What are you doing here? Jason: With a dream like this, you're gonna need help from somebody.

Mike: Dad! Dad! Well I could go upstairs, wake him up and tell him I need to talk to him, or I could be more subtle. What does it take to get a man out of bed? Carol: What are you doing, I'm trying to sleep. Mike: Well, I'm trying to conserve energy, Carol, by running our appliances at off-peak hours. Carol: Well, why don't you put on the toaster, it's quieter? Mike: Carol, why don't you go upstairs, circle three times and lay down? Carol: You're up to something. Mike: No I'm not. Carol: You dropped out of school. Mike: No. Carol: You burned down the garage! Mike: Carol. Carol: You held up a liquor store! Mike: Carol! Carol: Don't help me, this is fun. 
Mike: No Dad, come on, you were there, I kissed you! 


Jason: What are you into, Mike? Mike: Dad look, she wanted absolutely nothing to do with me at all. Jason: That's real? Mike: No, that's the dream. Jason: I wish I were charging you by the hour. Mike: OK, I'll make it simple for you; for the first time since Julie, I'm friends with a girl before I kiss her. Jason: But she has a boyfriend. Mike: Yes. Why now? Why her? Jason: Well, maybe part of what you like about Kate, is the fact that she is taken, Mike. I mean, maybe after everything you went through with Julie, you really don't get involved right now, so you 've concocted this attraction to someone who isn't available. wannaMike: Na, that's not it. What else you got?

Jason: Well the other possibility is, you really are attracted to her and you want to get serious about her. Mike: OK, OK, now what would I do in this case? Jason: Nothing. No Mike no, not as long as she's got a boyfriend. Best thing to do is to have as little to do with her as possible. Mike: But Dad, it's gonna be kind of tough, I mean I'm kissing this girl tomorrow from noon till four thirty. Jason: It's gonna be a real test of character. Mike: Her's. I was afraid of that. 
David: OK, let's take it from the train whistle. Right before the kiss. Mike: Ah...David have you fully explored the passion of a hearty handshake? David: Mike, I know, I know, I know what your problem is! Mike: You do? David: Yep and I got the solution. Mike: What, the solution is, you're leaving? 

Jason: Oh yeah? Go ahead, who's she gonna believe anyway? Maggie: Ben, telephone, it's Laura-Lynn! Ben: You asked who it was! Maggie: Yeah, is there a problem? Ben: Yeah, now she's gonna think that other girls call me too. I'm a dead man. Mike: Hey listen, now that you've finished with the game...oh, hi Mom. Maggie: Hey Mike, I hardly see you these days, what's new? Mike: Nothing. Maggie: You all ready for the play tomorrow night? Mike: Yep. Maggie: Oh, you guys wanna talk, huh? Mike: Oh, no, no, no, no, it's OK, we'll wait till you leave. Maggie: Oh, if you're asking for advice about women...listen to him, Jason.

Mike: Dad, Dad, the worst thing happened to me today. Jason: Why, did you tell her how you feel? Mike: No, she told me how she feels! Jason: How does she feel. Mike: Pretty darn good! Jason: Mike!Mike: No, no, no, Dad, I mean I didn't want this to happen. Jason: Come on, you didn't? Mike: Oh, well of course I did. But I didn't want it want it to happen. I guess I'm just irresistible. Jason: Come on Mike, you know better than this. Mike: Dad, come on, you think I wanted to mess up their relationship? Jason: No, OK, I don't. I'm sorry, I just...I have a prejudice against guys like you. Mike: Pardon me? 
Maggie: It had nothing to do with that charming boy who paid for my lunches, who now, by 


the way, is a millionaire. Professor Thorn: Our next production poses a dramatic question, what if Romeo and Juliet were mimes? Carol: If Lincoln were here to see this play, he'd kill himself. Ben: That was great, that was great! Carol: How can you say that? Ben: Well I could see right down her dress. 
David: We're on next, where the heck is Mike? Kate: I don't know. David: Oh, maybe those mimes will get an encore...who am I kidding? Kate: Mike, where have you been? Mike: I was running my lines.

Kate: Where, I've been looking all over for you. Mike: Ah, look Kate, can we just stick to the play. Kate: Mike, you can't keep avoiding me. Mike: It's just that I don't wanna talk about things that we can't talk about right now, OK? David: Mike! OK guys, this is it, and remember, that kiss means everything. Jason: Maggie, why are you keeping in touch with this Aaron guy? Maggie: Sshh. Professor Thorn: Our final one act of the evening is titled, The Passion, starring Kate McDonnell and Michael Seaver. Maggie: Woo! Excuse me. Professor Thorn: And directed by David Hogue, who's apparently not related to this lady at all. Jason: I asked you a question, Maggie. 
Maggie: Jason, listen, I wanna watch and see how Mike deals with having to kiss Kate, knowing how Kate feels and that her boyfriend's the director. Jason: You eavesdropped! So you're not really keeping in touch with this guy at all, are you? Maggie: No. But I could if you don't dummy up. (The Play) Mike: OK, it's time to make a choice; you can stay here in this town living other people's dreams or you can take a chance with me. Kate: Jeff, I can't decide my whole life in a moment. Mike: Well a moment's all we got. Then kiss me goodbye, Jessica. (They kiss) Jason: Wow Ben: That's what I call homework. Kate: Oh Mike! Mike: Oh Kate, I can't hide my feelings for you any more! I wish I could, but I can't. Maybe this is wrong. Kate: No, no, it's not wrong. Mike: We'll explain this to David. Kate: Yeah, we'll just tell him that we didn't plan for it to happen. Mike: Yeah and that we didn't even want it to happen. Kate: He'll understand. Mike: Oh yeah, he's a great guy. Kate: Oh, yeah, he's a great great guy. David: You guys! You guys were great! Oh look honey, I know I've been a total jerk for the last few weeks, but I know we can get things back the way they were, Katie. I love you. Professor Thorn: Alright people, it's time for the bows.

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Radio: It's two twenty five am and this is for all you lovers who still believe she's stuck in traffic. Mike: Yeah, that's probably it, Kate's probably just stuck in traffic, I mean, the theatre is all the way across campus. OK, I'll give her five more minutes, if she's not here by two thirty, I'm going home. (In Mike's head from the play in the last episode) Kate: I can't decide my whole life in a moment. Mike: Well a moment's all we got. Kate: Oh, Oh Mike! Mike: Oh Kate, I can't hide my feelings from you any more; I wish I could but I can't. Maybe this is wrong! Kate: No, no, it's not wrong.

Jason: I'm sorry, it's early, I'm a little groggy; I had to come up with something. Mike: Well, relax Dad, I spent the whole night in my car...alone, waiting for Kate. Jason: Oh, Mike, that's pathetic. Mike: Thank you Dad, for that boost. Jason: Sorry Mike, I didn't think we'd hit on anything this important before my morning coffee. Where you going? Mike: Up to my room so I can shower and get to school, find out where Kate's first class is, get there and ask her where she was last night. Or is that too pathetic for you? 

Mike: You know, you know, you're perfect for me. Cindy: Wait a second, Mike. We've been in this class together all semester and you've never given me the time of day. Mike: Well...well that's because I guess I've never been ready for a girl like you. You know, hey what about tonight? Maybe a movie, dinner, just a fun night with no spelling whatsoever. What do you say? Cindy: I say, Y. E. X.Mike: Very, very good. Errm...listen, I gotta get out of here. Kate: Mike, class is this way. Mike: Oh, I transferred out. Kate: Mike, hold on.

Mike: Tell me about it. 
Cindy: I'm still confused. Mike: OK, OK, what exactly didn't you get about the movie? 
Mike: Sure, OK. 


David: I gotta ask you a flavour. Mike: OK, ask. David: I gotta find out what's bothering Kate. Mike: Ah ha. David: Something's changed. Mike: Ah ha.

David: Will you talk to her? Mike: You mean, about what's bothering her? David: Mike, I need to know, alright? And she likes you, and I mean hey, you've been kissing her more lately than I have. Mike: Hey, you made me. David: Hey, look, Mike, I know; it's very difficult to be put in the middle situations like this, but... Mike: Oh, you have no idea. David: Well, listen to me, you're my only hope! Alright? I tried to talk to her last night, I tried to get her to open up, but we ended up fighting till dawn. Mike: You guys fought? David: Yeah. Mike: Oh, that's great...err...that you guys still have that kind of passion between you. 
David: Look, Mike, I'm not leaving until you tell me you'll talk to her. 

Professor Thorn: I know Seven a.m is very early my fellow thespians, but the purpose of this exercise is to tap the inner passions. Kaiser: I'm ready to tap, sir! Professor Thorn: Good Tizer, good. Now I want to hear the passion! Release the beast within. Get out! Out, all of you, out! Kaiser: This was fun professor, I've never released my beast before. So when do you wanna start rehearsing? Mike: Rehearsing what? Kaiser: While you were sleeping, I volunteered us to a scene from, Death of a Salesman. So, who do you wanna be, Willie Lowman, or his wife? Mike: Guess. Kaiser: Oh, come on, we can't both be the wife! Professor Thorn: It is so nice to share my time in hell with another human being. 
Mike: Huh? Kate: Oh, tell me you didn't ask out little miss bimbo to force me into making a decision. Mike: Err...I didn't, it was my Dad's idea. Kate: Right, and now you're gonna tell me she wasn't a bimbo, huh? huh? 
Kate: Mike... Mike: Look Kate, what am I explaining Cindy to you for, huh? It's really none of your business. Just like it's none of my business where you were when I was waiting outside your dorm for you, till dawn. Look Kate, I'm just trying to stay away from you and David. But now I've got him coming over and jumping in my bed, and you coming over and grilling me about some girl who can't even spell, yes... But she can sure say it. 
Mike: Yeah. Kate: Mike, David and I just argued, that's all. He told me that when he asked me to find out what's wrong between 
you guys. Woo, big news story. Kate: I have tried to tell him, he just won't listen, he's so bull-headed. Mike: Look, Kate, I'm just trying to do the right thing here. You know I'm trying to get you out of my mind, but it's not working. Kate: Good.Kaiser: Mike, I thought it over and I've been a pig; you can be my wife, and I'll be your Willy. 
(Mike's dream) David: Mike, Mike, what did Kate say? Mike: Look David, there's no need to put you through this torture; Kate doesn't love you, she loves me and I love her. David: What? You took my girl! You took my one reason for living! When don't you just shoot me?

Mike: What'd you shoot him for? Kate: For us. I'll go through his wallet. Mike: But...but that would be stealing. Kate: But taking me wasn't! Mike: No, no, no, Kat look, this is not how it's supposed to go. Look, this is all wrong...except for that outfit. Kate: Do you really like it or are you just saying that? Mike: Kate, Kate, pay attention, come on! This is how it's gonna go. David: Mike, Mike, what did Kate say? Mike: Look David, there's no need to put you through this torture. Kate doesn't love you, she loves me, and I love her. David: Oh, OK. Mike: OK! You mean, you're not mad! 

David: Friend! Mike: This wasn't how it was meant to go, at all. But this is how it went. 
Mike: Kate! Kate, come on, wake up! Kate: Mike! Mike: Yeah, it's me. Come on, open the door. Kate: Mike, it's the middle of the night. What's going on? Mike: Look Kate, this just can't wait. Kate: Oh Mike, look what happened to your eye. Mike: I know, look, David came over and I was half a sleep and I didn't mean to tell him, but... Kate: Tell him what? Mike: Look, he knew that I'd talked to you but, you know what a hot-head David can be; so I

told him that I was the reason that you two were having problems. He hit me! Kate: What? Mike: Yeah, can you believe, he hit me?Kate: You told him about us! Mike: Yes, look, at least now it's out in the open and David knows...the worst is over now! You hit me!Kate: How dare you tell him about us? Get out! Get out! Get out! Mike: Well if that's your attitude, I'm leaving. 
Jason: I understand everything you said, Mike. The only thing I don't get is why Kate hit you. Maggie: Oh, it makes perfect sense to me. Mike: Yeah, women are nuts! Right, Dad? Jason: Hey, hey. Well, Psychiatrists rarely like to use the term, nuts...besides we're out of steaks. 
Kaiser: Great class today, professor, and thanks for those super duper acting tips. 


Professor Thorn: Don't mention it Kaiser, that means a lot coming from a future bank teller. Kaiser: Oh, Mike... Professor Thorn: No, no, Kaiser, for the twentieth time, I do not have my dress for our scene! Kaiser: Women are nuts. Mike: Hey David, hey err...I just wanted to say that I was wrong for telling you what Kate wanted because I don't have a clue as to what Kate wants, and err...those things that I said, they were more wishful thinking than anything else. I got carried away and I'm sorry, I...I...really hope that you two can work things out. David: Yeah right. Mike: Hey, look man, I really want you to know that...that I'm truly sorry and...and I think of you as a friend. David: Well...on another day that might mean something, alright?

Kate: Hi. Mike: Hi. Kate: I've been waiting for you. Mike: Hey look, Kate, I just want you to know that I've already explained to David that I was completely out of line by speaking for you.Kate: No, you weren't. Mike: Pardon me. Kate: Well, even though you shouldn't have, it was the right thing to do. Mike: Look, Kate, I think it would be a lot easier if you'd just hit me again. Kate: Oh Mike... Mike: Look Kate, I just want you to know that I am going to back off, OK, until you and David can figure out whatever it is between you guys... Kate: Mike...I broke up with David today. Mike: Oh no, Kate, I don't think you should have done that for me. Kate: I didn't do it for you, I did it for me. It's something that I should have done a long time ago, so then when I met you, anything might have happened. Mike: Might have? Kate: Look, David feels lousy, you feel lousy, and I feel lousy. Mike: You're leaving? Kate: I don't know. Mike: Kate, why did you come? Kate: I'm not sure. Mike: Would now be a really bad time to put my arm around you? Kate: Yes, but I'd like it anyway.

Ben: Oh no, mount, Vesuvius is erupting! Honey you grab the kids, I'll start the chariot and... Glug, glug, glug, this is great, I gotta get an A. Carol: No you won't. Ben: Are you kidding? I got this baby rigged to blow at the push of a button. I mean, lava's gonna flow everywhere. Over Rhodes, Romans, gladiators, naked virgins. Carol: But you won't get an A. Ben: Why? Carol: Because people like you don't get A's, they just mark their time at school till they can take their rightful place in society as toll collectors. Ben: Put your face over my volcano and say that. Carol: Ha ha ha. Maggie: Ben, I need that table cleared off, I'm coming back with lots of groceries for your father's party. Ben: But it's not till tomorrow and I haven't even had my first test firing yet. Maggie: Get that mountain thingy out of my kitchen, now! Ben: It's not a mountain thingy, it's a... Carol: C plus, tops. Maggie: Jason, we never got an RSVP from the Blankenships! Jason: Yes we did! Rich told me at the office! Maggie: Well you didn't tell me. Jason: The Blankenships are coming to the reception tomorrow. Maggie: OK, then that makes fifty four people. Jason: And the Johnsons, too. Maggie: How many others have you forgotten to tell me about?Jason: None, Maggie! Well the Schneiders. 
Maggie: Look, Jason, how can I plan for this thing if you keep changing the number of people who are coming? Jason: Relax honey, that's fifty eight and we ordered food for sixty! Wonder if it's too late to call the caterer and cut back the order. Just a thought. Maggie: Jason, I just want everything to be perfect, I mean we don't know these people and I mean, they're important and rich; they're people you read about in the paper. Jason: And they're no different from we are. Mike: Huh, they sure are! They wanna blow five hundred Bucks a pop, just to hang out at our place. Jason: They're not blowing five hundred Dollars, Mike, they're donating it. And it's for the free mental health clinic, a very worthy cause, thank you. Mike: Hey, if they're dropping five hundred Bucks a head, they should just skip this party and check into the clinic. Jason: I'll get it. Mike: Hey Mom, how come we never start cleaning a day early for a family party?

Maggie: Well, they don't have to like us, they're related to us. Norma: Out of my way, it's heavy. Jason: Excuse me, who are you? Norma: No time to talk, I'm running late. Maggie: This is our caterer, Norma. Norma: Charmed, I'm sure. Look, where do you want your sea-food medley?Jason: I want it on ice, Norma, the party's tomorrow. Norma: No, it's not. Jason: Yes it is. It's my party. Norma: My work order says today. Jason: Yeah, well my wallet don't start talking till tomorrow, Norma. Norma: Fine, I'll let it rot in my refrigerator. Jason: Maggie, where'd you get this caterer? Maggie: Jason, they came highly recommended. 
Maggie: Jason, this calendar's from nineteen eighty five. Honey, you can't re-use these things! 


Jason: The party's today! Mike: Maybe this trump dude will help us buff our floors. 
Jason: We've got fifty eight people on their way over here, we got twenty three minutes to turn this house into a party, let's go, let's go!! Look wait a minute! Wait a minute! Where are you going? Carol: Well, I was gonna go and pick out a dress for Donald Trump. Mike: This guy wears dresses! Jason: Can we just please forget about Mr. Trump for a second and think about what's important here! Come on we got twenty three, we got twenty two minutes for a party! Maggie: You aren't even going to apologise, are you? Jason: For what, Maggie?

Maggie: You don't know! You really don't know! Jason: Maggie, we got fifty eight people coming here in twenty one minutes!! Maggie: And they'll find a house unprepared for a party, and who are they gonna blame? The respected, responsible husband or the long suffering wife? Mike: What about the idiot daughter? Maggie: No, the wife! They always blame the wife. I guess that my humiliation means nothing to you! Jason: Oh, it will mean plenty, right after the party, Maggie. Maggie: Oh, you have no idea. Carol: I'll get it, it might be Donny again. Jason: Well tell him to hover. Come on, we got a lot to do here, a lot to do!! I'll make a list of the chores. Mike: Well, at least you had twenty good years with the man, Mom. 

block-head when he sent the food away. Jason: Oh, honey, I'm sorry about that whole date thing. Maggie: Oh, big man. Jason: Oh, come on honey, we got plenty of food. Maggie: No we don't, I didn’t' get the chance to go shopping yet. Jason: Hey, how about these dumb microwaveable meatballs, the one's even Ben won't eat. Come on, and we got veggies Sweetheart, you can make one of those stupid dips! Maggie: Stupid dips! Jason: Tasty. Maggie: Jason, we have sixty rich people and Donald Trump on their way to a filthy house and now we're gonna starve them? Jason: Starve! Honey, with happy tasty meat treats! Delicious, can't even spoil! Maggie: I won't serve them.

Jason: Well, I will. And a semi eaten breakfast sausage, we'll file it down, nobody'll know the difference. Maggie: Oh great Jason, we'll just serve them these and refuse to call the ambulance until they've signed the cheques. Jason: We've got seventeen minutes, what do you want to do? Maggie: Leave the country! Jason: Maggie, come on, put a little perspective on this. Yes, OK, we've got sixteen minutes and yes yes we have no food and yes the house is in a shambles, but honey, we can make this work! Yes, come on, if this happened on Perfect Strangers, would Bulky lose it? Don't be ridiculous. Maggie: I hate that show! Jason: You love Lucy. Lucy, remember Lucy and Ethel and they were in the candy factory and they had that little conveyor belt and the thing was going along like this, and they were... 

people are dumb enough to pay five hundred Dollars just to get inside the door, think what they'd pay to sit down! Jason: Mike, come on, that's...interesting. Ooh, less than thirteen minutes. Mike: Come on, what do we do? What do we do? Jason: We gonna help your mother lay out all the foo.... Wow, look at this it's gonna be great Mike, we're gonna pull this thing off. Maggie: I have just been routing through garbage cans for food. This is what my marriage to you has led to. Jason: Oh, honey, come on. Maggie: Oh, I can't do it! Call me old-fashioned, but I just can't serve garbage. Jason: We don't need any more trash honey, these appetizers are spectacular! And we got twelve minutes to spare! Maggie: Oh, I haven't even showered.

Jason: Go, go, go, shower! Maggie: Ben, if you don't take that volcano out of here, I am gonna erupt. Ben: But you said to... Maggie: Ben... Ben: Dad. Jason: You heard your mother. Carol: Bathrooms are clean, I can see my face in the toilets. Mike: Well then, that makes it unanimous. Jason: What the heck is that, you've got a... (volcano erupts, everybody screams) Ben: It works! It works! It works! 
Ben: Did you see that sucker blow? You tell me I'm gonna screw up now, huh? Jason: Ben, come on, you ruined every thing here. Ben: No, I'm sure, if I can get it to work once, it will work... 
Mike: Ah, excuse us, excuse us. Dad, we have food right here staring us in the face, and the 


people are showing up here in eight minutes, what are you doing? Jason: Mike, I can't lie to the guy. Mike: But Dad, think of all the people you're gonna be helping with your health clinic. Jason: Mike, there's never a time to lie. Son, we ordered five pizzas, not one. And that was thirty one minutes ago, so they're free. Pizza boy: Oh, come on. Jason: Don't mess with me kid, I got nothing to lose. Mike: And I thought there was never a time to lie. Jason: I was lying! I was lying! look, I'm not Cussman, I'm a psychiatrist, but I need this food 
Mike: Is this a fabulous machine, or what? Jason: Alright, everything's all cleaned up, we got five minutes to shower shampoo and get dressed.

Maggie: Alright, bite-sized pizza. Jason: Oh honey, I'm sorry I called you pudding head. Maggie: Mmm, and I'm sorry I said I wished you'd got our wedding date wrong. Jason: When'd you say that? Maggie: Several times today. Jason: Be faster if we shower together. Carol: Oh great, this sink is clogged. Mike: Hey, that's no problem at all for the owner of a wet-dry vac. Just step aside, both of you. Allow me. Just put your hose in the right port, and blow your problems away. If you'll notice, I'm not even working up a sweat. Maggie: Carol!Jason: What's going on? Maggie: The food! 

Maggie: Oh, Stinky, you are wonderful. Jason: How'd you know we needed food? Stinky: Ben called me. Maggie: Our Ben. Stinky: And I brought my accordian in case you wanna get down and get funky. 
Jason: now just get everybody casual now. Casual. Maggie: Casual. Jason: Somebody should get the door. No, I'll get it. Stinky: If I can do anything to help, just ask. Jason: Yeah. Hello, come in, welcome. Rich: Hi, I'm Rich. Mike: Boy, these people just come right out and say it.

Jason: Drive safely, thank you. Listen, thank you so much for that contribution, Rich. Rich: I had a fabulous afternoon. Rich's wife: Your eclectic display of food was an eloquent statement on the needy causes of today. Maggie: Well, we figured...why put on a show. Jason: And hey listen, your donation was really more than I ever could have hoped for. Rich: Well I figured, the more people we have feeling good about themselves, the less people we have calling me a heartless slum lord. Jason: Words to live by. Rich: Ta-ta. Maggie: Ta-ta. Jason: Thank you. 
Rich's wife: Good bye dear, nice to meet you. Maggie: Nice meeting you. Jason and Maggie: Woo!Jason: We did it. Carol: How can you say that? I didn't even get to meet Donald Trump. Stinky: Oh, I forgot that dude was here. Maggie: What? 
Carol: You met Donald Trump! Stinky: Yeah, who is he? Mike: I'm not the only stupid one around here. Stinky: But he told me to give you this. Jason: Ten thousand Dollars!!! Ben: For some beef jerky and Cool-ade! Jason: Hey, hey, we did alright guys! Maggie: Oh, we did! Jason: Yes. You know the true test of character is grace under pressure, and I think we all scored pretty darn well today. Come on, we pulled together as a family, as a team. Nobody got petty, nobody got selfish, nobody got irrational. Maggie: Here here! Jason: Now, let's remember that in the troubled times ahead. Ben: I'm really glad you made that speech, because for a while there, I was starting to think 
Jason: Ah, you're not alone Ben. For a while I had my doubts about this whole silly episode.

I'll be in women's underwear. No, I didn't get permission yet, but don't worry, it's no sweat. Mike: Benny, excuse me! Women's underwear! Ben: What's that for? I'm not gonna be wearing it, I'm just gonna be in the women's underwear department. Mike: Oh, and that makes it OK! Ben: Why do you keep hitting me? Come on, Mike, me and Stinky are just going down to the mall to get our ears pierced in ladies' jewellery. Come on, a lot of guys get their ears pierced now! Mike: I know, I just like smacking you around. Ben: Well, cut it out, I gotta stay cool for when I ask Mom for permission. Mike: Mom! Benny look, you got a better shot at getting permission to wear women’s underwear. Ben: You think so! Mike: Oh, Benny, the woman has no sense of humour. I mean, if you even ask her, she'll probably wash something out with soap...your mouth, if you're lucky. Ben: Na, na, see Mike, you don't get it. I don't wanna have to tell you this but...well, I am the woman's favourite child, she told me so. Mike: Oh, come on Benny, she tells every one of us that, and we're supposed to keep it some big secret. Ben: Oh no! Mike: Look, I'll tell you my advice; ask Dad to get your ear pierced. Jason: And he'll say yes. Mike: Oh, not a shot. He'll say, son, is this really what you want? I think not. Ben: Then, how is that better? Mike: Because, for a long time you guys can discuss it, and as you discuss it, you can bring up another couple of things that you want, like a leather jacket, or boots with metal toes on them and then Dad will feel so bad about saying no to the earrings that he'll cave on that. Ben: You've actually tried this? Errm...thanks for the advice, Mike, but I think I'll work my magic with Mom. Mike: I'm telling you... Ben: Hello, Mother. Maggie: Hi Benny, Mike. Ben: Ah, me and Stinky are going down to the mall. Maggie: Oh, fine. Ben: Be back by dinner. Maggie: Fine. Oh, there it is. Ben: I'm gonna get my ear pierced, if that's OK? Maggie: Fine.

favourite child. Maggie: Get your ear pearled! Ben: Ah, yeah. Maggie: Right, Benny, in your dreams. Ben: Mom, can't we at least discuss this? Maggie: No we can't. I am not going to have a child of mine disfiguring his face for fashion. Mike: That's what I told him. Maggie: Mike, what do you have to do with this? Mike: Well, I'm just trying to help, Mom. Look, if you need the kid smacked around a little bit, I'm happy to serve! Jason: Hello everybody, I'm... Ben: Dad, will you tell Mom, it's just a small hole that can grow shut. Jason: ...home. Ben: Hey, all the other guys are getting 'em. 
Jason: Save it, it's not what it looks like, OK? I am not whipped. I am simply empathizing with your mother's position here; she wants me to step aside so she can do the parenting, and that's very important for her own self-worth. 

Mike: I was just gonna ask you to borrow some money. Jason: I thought you wanted to talk... Ha ha. Mike: Ha ha. Jason: Ha ha. Mike: So what do you say? Jason: Na, na. 
Maggie: Where do you get these ideas? From now on I am gonna have to keep a much closer eye on your friends, your TV viewing habits, your record albums, and maybe I'll even monitor a phone call or two. Ben, you've had too much freedom, and it's coming to a halt. Ben: Is Dad coming in soon? Maggie: No, Ben, I am handling this, not your father. Ben: Yes, ma'am. And I was just telling Stinky how you're so understanding and your so much

better than Dad is. Maggie: Don't try to con me... Really? No, no, Ben, getting an earring is just not something I'm gonna allow you to do. Ben: But you have your ears pearled, right? Maggie: Yes, I do. Ben: And so does Carol, right? Maggie: Yes... Ben: So, this is sexism. Maggie: Sexism! Ben: Yeah, it means making a decision... Maggie: I know what it means, Ben. Nice try, but ah ah! Ben: Well can I at least go down to the mall and tell Stinky, I'm not allowed. Maggie: Stinky's already there! Ben: Yeah, he's waiting for me in women's underwear. 
Jason: Fine. Maggie: Fine. Jason: Being sensitive to your needs here, Maggie, I recognize that you want to get back into that day-to-day parenting mode, without me, over your shoulder, second guessing you all the time. Even though...you know, not all the things you do are...quite right. Maggie: I see. Jason: I don't mean that they're wrong, either Maggie, just err... Maggie: Ah ha. 

Jason: Boy, something smells good around here! Maggie: Oh! I can't imagine why, I haven't started dinner yet. Jason: No, that's my point; imagine how good it's gonna smell when you do. 
Maggie: So, Stinky's not there either. Aha, well when Ben shows up, please send him home, he was due back an hour ago. Yes, thank you Mrs. Sullivan. Don't say it. Jason: What? I wasn't gonna say a word about how this is the first time I can remember Ben being late for a meal. Mike: Oh, Mom, I am starved, when’s dinner? Maggie: After Ben gets home and I check his ears for holes, which I better not find, or he will rue the day he was born. Mike: Well can I get something to go? I'll wait. Hey, Dad, why are you smiling? Jason: No, n...n...no I'm not smiling. I'm not. Yes, I'm smiling but it's just the love that I have

for all of you bubbling out. Carol: Hi! Sorry I'm late for dinner. Mike: You're not. Mom and Dad are fighting. Jason and Maggie: We are not. Mike: See. Maggie: Carol, sit, we'll eat as soon as Ben gets back. Carol: Back from where? Mike: From not getting an earring. Carol: An earring. Well Dad, I assume you nipped that in the bud. Maggie: No, he didn't, I did. Not your father, me; the woman who bore you after eighteen hours of labour. Carol: Sorry, I just assumed that Dad jumped in and took over like he always does. Jason: I certainly did not. 

Maggie: A tattoo, a tattoo, you got a tattoo! Ben: But it says, mother. Maggie: I don't care what it says, Ben. Do you realise for the rest of your life you'll be walking around with my name on your arm?Ben: Well, we could add an S, and it would say, smother. Maggie: Oh. Don't tempt me, Ben. How could you do this to your body? Do you realise that when I was pregnant with you, I walked around for nine months and didn't have a single cup of coffee so that your body would be perfect. Now look at you, I could have gone to Columbia and sucked beans off trees. Ben: You never said I couldn't get a tattoo. Maggie: OK, fine, fine. Then let's go over all the other possibilities. You not stick Knives up you nose, you may not gargle with razor blades, you may not drink water directly out of the toilet. Ben: So, Mom, are you saying that this tattoo is a lot worse than a little hole in my ear?

Jason: No. Maggie: I'm saying it means no more short-sleeved shirts, ever. Mike: Why don't you go up there and straighten this thing out? Jason: No, no, that wouldn't be fair to your mother. Maggie: Ben, I am starting to get angry. Mike: Well, don't you think she's a little nuts over some tattoo that just washes off. Jason: Yeah. Mike: You think that maybe she doesn't know that it's a fake? Jason: Hey Mike, it's not my place to second guess what your mother does or doesn't know about these matters. Mike: Oh, come on Dad, somebody's got to tell her that Ben's just trying to freak her out with this tattoo, so that an earring would be a relief. Jason: Hey, wait, wait, wait. Don't you go anywhere. Mike: Dad, if this keeps up, she's gonna throw him out the window! 

Maggie: Carol, please, I don't need any more advice right now, please. Carol: But Mom, I see your strategy here and I just want to tell you, woman-to-woman, I think it's brilliant. Maggie: Pardon me. Carol: You're gonna have the last laugh on Dad. Maggie: What are you talking about? Carol: He's down there with Mike, just waiting for you to blow it. Maggie: He is! Carol: He actually thinks that you're foolish enough to believe Ben's tattoo is real. Maggie: He does. Carol: Now I see where Ben gets his gullibility. Maggie: Yeah, well, I...

Carol: I meant Ben. Maggie: Oh, well right, I can see Carol, that you're on to my plan. Carol: Men, who needs 'em. 
Maggie: Ben... Ben: Mom, there’s something I wanna tell you... Maggie: Let me guess. That that tattoo washes off. Ben: You knew that! Maggie: Of course I did. Ben: Wow. Maggie: Didn't you expect me to be that smart? 
Maggie: Jason, is it too much to expect you to trust me to handle a little thing like this? Jason: Well, is it too much for me to ask you exactly what was said? Maggie: No, no, no, it's just the reason why you're asking. I mean you were dying to jump in 

to tell me what to do, and now you're dying to know what I did so that you can see that I didn't blow it. Jason: Oh, come on honey, now that's not true. You know, it's just that all those years that you worked, well this was my job, and I kind of miss it. And I have every confidence that you just dealt with it great. Maggie: Good. Good night. Jason: Bet I can even tell you what you did. Maggie: Oh? Jason: Yep. I bet you punished Ben for that whole tattoo scam and then you hung tough on your decision for no earring, right? Maggie: Possibly. Jason: Possibly! Maggie: Oh, Jason, if I tell you what I did, do you promise not to criticize, do you promise not

to second guess? Jason: Word of honour. Maggie: OK, I didn't punish Ben for his fake tattoo thing. Jason: Oh, Maggie!!! Maggie: Jason, you promised. And I told him that if it was really important to him that he could have his earring. Jason: No, come on Maggie. Maggie: Jason I... Jason: No, I was going like this. 
Mike: Oy Dad, Dad, what did Ben get? Jason: Mike, this doesn't concern you. Mike: Oh, come on, Dad, what did Mom give him? One month, two months, no allowance? 

Maggie: You want Ben to get his ear pearled now? Jason: Oh, I don't know what I told him Maggie... Wait a minute, isn't that what you told him? Maggie: No, I told him he had to wait two months and then see if he really wanted it. Jason: Well you didn't mention that last night! Maggie: Well with all the clapping it must have slipped my mind. Carol: Did, I hear the little rat-face right? Dad put his two Cents in and messed everything up. Jason: Carol, basically...yes. Maggie: Carol, go tell Ben that my original punishment still stands. Carol: Gladly, and if he resists, I'll slap him around. Jason: You were playing with me. Maggie: God help me, I was. Jason: Why?

kids now that you're gone during the day. Jason: Honey, I do trust you. Maggie: Sure, now. Jason: It was still a dirty trick. Maggie: Thank you. Honey, believe me, I know what you're going through. You were here with them all day every day and all of a sudden you're out there working and you're not here to deal with every problem. Jason: And I know what you're going through, three o' clock in the afternoon and all hell breaks loose, and yours is the only voice of reason, and you're not even sure about that. Maggie: So, we do understand each other. Jason: We always have. You know that I could point out that the way you ended up handling Ben is exactly the way I would have done it. Maggie: You could, but you won't, right? 
Jason: Right. I could point out that two parents, parenting as parents is what parenting is all about, Maggie. I could point out that with my training and experience with child-rearing, it's a very valuable tool in guiding our kids on the guide of life. I could point out all of that Maggie, but I won't...and that's why I won't. 沪江英语编辑部www.hjenglish.com 沪江英语出品www.hjenglish.com 版权所有请勿转载使用者请及时到沪江英语下载最新版本脚本

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Ben: I can't believe it! I just can't believe it; Laura-Lynn standing me up, me! And on Valentine's Day. Carol: Ben, why do you keep going with Laura-Lynn if she makes you so miserable? I mean, I don't mean to sound judgmental but it makes you look like a pathetic dork. Ben: At least I'm not hanging out with the girls from the office, seeing how much we can eat. If Laura's not here in five minutes, I'm sucking the middles out of these babies. Mom, when do struggles with the opposite sex stop? Maggie: At the funeral home. Ben: Shouldn't you have hired a lift for your date with Dad? Maggie: You mean with the man who is an hour late on Valentine's Day and hasn't called? Ben: Ah, don't feel bad, Mom. Wanna help me suck these chocolates? Jason: Hey, hi everybody, sorry I'm a little late. Maggie, you're not mad, are you? Maggie: Well, I'm sure you have a really good reason. You probably got tied up with a patient in emergency or got caught in traffic, or something. Jason: Ha ha, actually I just forgot we were going out for dinner tonight. Isn't that funny? Maggie: You forgot our Valentine's dinner, and that's funny! Jason: Well, but when I remembered I remembered flowers. Maggie: Where'd you get these? The off ramp at exit seven?

Laura-Lynn: Let's go Ben, my mom's in the car waiting. Oh, hello Doctor Seaver, hi Mike. Mike: Hi.Jason: Hi. Ben: Let me finish getting my coat on. Laura-Lynn: Why aren't you ready? Do you know we're late? Ben: Look Laura, I don't know why you're yelling at me, you're the one who's late; maybe we shouldn't even go on this stupid date. Laura-Lynn: Ben, you've never been forceful with me before...I like it. Stand up straight.

Oh wow, Alfredo Romano, that sounds great. Kate: Mike, that's the chef's name. Look, I just think we'd be more comfortable eating at another restaurant. Mike: Look Julie...I mean Kate! Look, no, no, don't worry. I appreciate that but I'm fine. I can handle this. Kate: I wasn't thinking about you, I was thinking about me. Mike: What have you got to do with this? Kate: Mike! This isn't exactly a pleasant situation for me. Mike: Oh, oh, oh! You mean you having dinner with your new boyfriend and being served by his former fiancée is not a pleasant situation. Kate: Maybe in California. Come on Mike, admit it, you're a little uneasy yourself. 

Mike: Like what, Kate? Kate: Like someone who has a secret. Mike: Oh, come on, give me a break. Kate: Give me a break! I mean, you're acting like you're sorry you ended that relationship. Mike: Well, that is not true. Kate: Mike, be honest with me! Mike: Ho...honest! honest, you want honest, OK. Alright, I didn't dump her! I'm the one who got dumped. Kate: What? Mike: I didn't call the wedding off, it was her. OK, I lied. I'm sorry. I did it to spare your feelings. No, I lied to spare my feelings. Kate: What else have you lied about? Mike: Nothing.

Kate: I love you too, Mike. So, why didn't you say goodbye to her? Mike: To Judy? Wa...w...wait, whats-her-name? Don't help me. 
Maggie: Next year, I pick the restaurant. Jason: Maggie, that salad bar was eighty feet long. Maggie: Honey, Valentine's day is not a time to be standing in line carrying a tray. It's not very romantic. Jason: Yeah, well we got great left-overs. Maggie: Honey, are you really this cheap? Jason: Maggie... No. For putting up with me, through all the times that I know what I'm doing and that one time of year that I don't... Maggie: Oh... Jason. Jason! Jason: Happy Valentines. Maggie: Oh... Thank you, it's beautiful. Jason: Yeah, they look like real diamonds, don't they? Maggie: Oh, no, they're real. Jason: Mike! Maggie: How was La Village? 
Mike: Look, if you think you are the only one who had doubts about what we were doing Julie, 


you're wrong! I had better doubts! Julie: Really? Mike: You bet! Julie: Oh, that's wonderful. Mike: Why are you hugging me? Julie: Well don't you see, I...I thought I broke your heart and I've been going around for months just feeling so lousy. You had doubts too, this is great! Mike: Yeah, it's a real hoot! Julie: Mike, why are you so upset? You just said you had the same questions. Mike: But Julie, at least I had the guts to come and tell you face to face...eight months after it happened.

Julie: Are you really being honest? Mike: Honest...you want, honest? OK. What is it with you women and this honesty thing? Julie: Mike! Mike: OK, OK. OK, I would have said, that you were crazy and that you were just having cold feet...and how could this be wrong, if we were so right for each other. Julie: And I would have looked into your eyes and I would have just crumbled. See why I wrote the letter now? Mike: Yeah. Guess I was a dope, huh? Julie: No you weren't. You were a charming, wonderful, romantic... Mike: Dope! Julie: No more than I was. I'm glad you came in here tonight, Mike. Mike: Yeah, I'm glad I came back. Julie: You changed. Mike: Yeah. I'm older, wiser, honester. Julie: Honester! Mike: Yeah, I've changed, my hasn't. Well, err...I gotta go. Julie: Good to see you, Mike, and you take care. Mike: Good bye. Julie: Good bye.

Mr. Seaver, if someone is going to teach at this school, they have got to be qualified. Mike: Oh, so this is a new policy then. Dewitt: Get out. Mike: OK, fine. At least I showed up, so I get my money. Dewitt: Great, from my own pocket. Mike: Great, this is even easier than teaching. Dewitt: Pardon me? Secretary: He said... Dewitt: I know what he said! You think teaching is easy! Mike: Well, yeah. You just get up in front of a bunch of kids and you, you know... Dewitt: Teach. Mike: Right. Dewitt: And that's...easy.

You were saying... Dewitt: I was saying... Wait a minute, you expect me to fall for this act? You're paying these people off, of course. Mike: Mr. Dewitt, I...I'm not paying anyone off, alright? And even if I did, it wouldn't have worked.

Mr. you better have a real good reason for being out of your seat, and Mr. get your ears away from this door, as this conversation has nothing to do with you! Dewitt: Good golly, Miss Molly. Mike: What? Dewitt: There's theory among educators that all talk about when we gather at the...teacherplace
.Thetheorygoeslikethis;ifwe couldtakeoneofourgoof-offs,theones weawho suck up our energy and give nothing back. If we could take such a student and turn him so that he could use his powers for good instead of evil, he, oh he, would be the perfect teacher...the one! The one, we've always been waiting for. You could be this man. Mike: Me, a perfect teacher? Dewitt: Chilling, isn't it? Mike: Well, Mr. Dewitt, I don't know about being perfect, but I sure smell like a teacher. Dewitt: Ah, yes, the mixture of flop sweat and cheap clothing, I know it well. Mike: Hey, look Mr. Dewitt, I'm really sorry for all the grief I ever gave you... Dewitt: Well Mike, if you're the one, none of that matters.

Dewitt: Mr. Seaver... Mike: I got to go check on my class, alright? And thank you for all the nice things you said about me. Dewitt: Maybe I am imagining all this. Maybe I am hallucinating. I know, I have the flu. I do. I have the flu. I'm out of here. 
Jason: Wait a minute, slow down. You've had quite a day now, just take it easy. You've learned something today, nobody ever thought you would...especially your parents. The question is, what are you gonna do with all this new found knowledge? Listen to me, now are you not to

Carol: Mike, forget your car! This is bigger than your stinking car! Mike: Boy, prison has made you a bitter woman. Carol: Mom, Dad, I want a full vindication, and I will not rest until my name is clear. Jason: W...wait, wait, Carol, this could drag on for months and months. Do you really want that to happen? Carol: Well you always told me not to lie, and I do not want to say I'm guilty when I'm not. Maggie: What if this thing goes to trial and somehow they find you guilty of resisting arrest. You could go to prison. Carol: I'm innocent. Maggie: Carol, sometimes they find innocent people guilty, you've got to remember what's important here. Mike: My car! Maggie: No. Your future. Carol: Mom! 
Carol: Mmm. Sidney: Don't worry, I'll take good care of you. Mike: I'm Mike and I could use a little care myself. Sidney: I may have to throw you to the wolves to save your sister. Maggie: So, this is why you didn't mind taking our lawyer out to lunch and didn't mind paying. 

Judge: Old judge's joke. Sidney: Your honour, my client... Judge: Hold your water a sec, honey. Now, this is the case of the people versus the rude little college girl, right? Carol: Well, I don't really start Columbia till next fall. Sidney: Carol, the judge doesn't want to hear about your college plans. Judge: Sure he does. What are you majoring in? Carol: Well, I'm not really sure yet. I was thinking of something in business, but lately I've... Sidney: Your honour, if we may my client would like to enter her plea now. Judge: Easy councilor, you act like you're late for a racket ball game, or something. Mmm, that's a nice dress. Now, it says here, you're gonna plead guilty to resisting and pay a fine. Carol: Well... Sidney: That's correct sir.

It's my first name. Who the hell are you, sport? Mike: I'm...you know, her brother. Judge: Oh, the parking ticket kid. I'll deal with you later. Mike: Thank you, your holiness. Carol: Look, judge... Judge: Herman. Carol: Herman, I don't think I did any thing wrong. Jason: Carol. Judge: Are you her defendant? Jason: No. Judge: You wanna be? Jason: No, sir Judge: Then, sit. Now, Carol, how do you wanna handle this thing? Carol: Well, what are my choices? 
Judge: Oh, I almost forgot about that parking ticket thing. 


Jason: Oh, errm... Judge: Mr. Seaver, it says you had four hundred Dollars worth of tickets in your glove compartment. Mike: Ah, yes, your grace. Judge: This is a VW rag top convertible isn't it? Mike: Well yeah, but what does that... Judge: It so happens that I've been looking for one of those for my no account grandkid. I'll give you four hundred Dollars for it.

Jason: Hey. Carol, it's me who owes you an apology. Thank God you had the good sense to disobey me. Carol: Pardon me? Maggie: Carol, I think what your father's means is that sometimes it's just best to...ignore him. Jason: Something like that. Carol: Thank you. Now I've got to get to the office. Jason: Come on, we'll give you a lift. Carol: Oh, on the way, can we stop at Columbia University? Jason: Sure, why? Carol: I wanna pick up a catalogue. Maggie: Don't we have other catalogues? Carol: Not the pre-law one. Jason: Law? Carol, are you... Carol: Dad, I'm just thinking. Now, it didn't occur to me till last night that something like this could happen to me, and if it can it can happen to anybody. Jason: Law school! Maggie: Alright! Oh honey.

Maggie: You're wearing your coat. Jason: OK, then we have a couple more minutes. Mike: Dad, did you take me to my first day at pre-school? Jason: Yeah, yeah. Missed the seventh game of the world series because of you. Ben: What about me? Jason: Missed the Reagan-Carter debate. That's why you've always been my favourite. Maggie: Look Jason if you don't wanna go... Jason: I wanna go! I'm coming! I wanna go! I've been waiting for Carol to stop babbling here so we could hit the road. 
Carol: Mom, Dad, I just think it's wonderful that you two are willing to start all over again with Chrissy, at your age. Just yesterday there was a segment on Operah, People with Kids. 
Teacher: Is everybody ready for the toothbrush? Kids: Yeah! Teacher: Everybody brush your teeth! Ready, this is it! Up and down, all around, everybody sit! Maggie: Jason, they're so young.

Jason: Wait, wait, wait, you're going out now? Come on, it's after ten! Mike: Come on, Dad, the party won't be going good till at least one or two. 

Maggie: Mike! Mike: Guys, guys, lighten up! Weren't you two ever young? Maggie: Not that I can recall. Mike: What'd I say? Jason: Oh, just the worst possible thing at the worst possible time. Mike: I didn't mean it. Jason: You've got a gift. Get out, Mike. Mike: You got it. Jason: Honey, come on, I think you're over reacting...

Maggie: It is ten fifteen, Ben.Ben: Well that's why the night seemed to drag on and on. Maggie: I said, freeze, Mr. And I want the truth. Ben: Oh, Mom, Dad, I'm sorry; I didn't think you'd still be awake. Maggie: Oh, you think it's tough to stay up past ten! Ben: It always has been. Jason: So, you just figured you'd just sneak in; nobody'd be the wiser, huh? Ben: Isn't the important thing here, that I'm home safe? Maggie: Who says you're safe? Jason: Ben, Ben, Ben, don't you think your mother and I are gonna get just a little tired of having this conversation over and over again? Ben: Well, then imagine how I feel. Maggie: Ben, can the wise-guy stuff, I am in no mood. 
Maggie: Oh, you wanna see tired? Wait till Chrissy's a teenager. Jason: Oh, well didn't you and I always say that we wanted to grow old together? 

Maggie: Yeah. You're only being rational because you're a year younger than me. Jason: Thirteen months. Come on! We got a couple of good years left. Why don't you go and take care of Chrissy while you still can. 
Maggie: Coming Chrissy! Mommy's coming! Carol: Mom, Chrissy's crying. Maggie: Thank you, Carol. Carol: Mom, you look tired. Maggie: Well, kids can take a lot out of you.

You probably haven't done the math, Chrissy, but by the time you're eighteen, I'm gonna be...Oh, I'm gonna be... 
(Maggie's dream) Maggie: We caught you this time, Chrissy Seaver! Jason: This is getting really old, young lady. Chrissy: Tell me about it.

Chrissy: No wonder these clothes kind of smell. 
Maggie: Yes. Chrissy: You know, it makes me unhappy when I have to follow your rules. Maggie: Oh, Jason, look, we've made her cry. 

Jason: I'm sorry, sweetheart. Chrissy: But now you're gonna ground me! Maggie: Oh, no we aren't, are we Jason? Jason: No, siry! Chrissy: But somehow you're gonna punish me for coming in just a few days late. Jason: Yes, and your punishment will be...think about what you have done and why it's wrong. Chrissy: OK. Done. Well, now that that's settled I'm gonna get something to eat. You guys are the best. Maggie: Oh, Jason, Jason, she's done it again. Jason: She did what? Maggie: She conned us out of punishing her! Jason: Oh, yeah, she's a smart one, isn't she? Well, she cuts classes and gets straight A's. Maggie: Yeah, she's got Mike's soul and Carol's brain.

Jason: Yeah, I know what you're gonna say, that she won't listen to reason... Maggie: What? Jason: But didn't my long-winded discussions make a difference with Mike and Carol and...Ben?

Chrissy: Yes, Mom, I love him very much. Jim: And Doctor and Mrs. Seaver, I'm an honest kind of guy, so I wanna tell you I don't really love your daughter, but with a body like that I'm gonna learn to.

Maybe I'll try the old, be your self lecture, you know, the one Mike never listened to? Maggie: No more lectures! I'm taking over...Jason. Jason, you've lost it. I saw this coming from the day we took Chrissy to play school and you wanted to watch that stupid basketball game. Jason: Maggie, you always had such enthusiasm for my skills as a parent. Maggie: Yes, a long time ago. But frankly Jason, and I'll just say it, I've been faking my enthusiasm for years. Jason, have you heard a word I've said? Jason: Did the Knicks win that game, or is my memory faulty? Maggie: Oh. Oh! 
Maggie: Oh, my God, I can't believe this! Jason: Yeah, that Jim can really shake his booty. Maggie: Everyone shut up and listen now! Partiers: Wow! 

Maggie: Mike, so you have been listening to us all these years! Jason: Us! I didn't hear him quoting you there, Maggie. Mike: Well, when I heard you two were in trouble, I left the office and got here as quick as I could. Maggie: Oh, Mike, I've been meaning to ask you; what is it that you actually do? Mike: Well, I don't really know. I'm very successful. Maggie: Jason, our son is successful. Carol: Mom, Dad! When my parents need me, the supreme court can wait. Is everything alright? Maggie: Oh, everything's wonderful...because of Mike. Ben: I should've known. I left work early for nothing. Jason: Ben, what is it you do again? Ben: I work for Mike.

Mike: As Dad said over and over, it doesn't really matter what we do because we're family, we rally together and we love you guys! Why else would we all still be living in this house? Maggie: Jason, this is like a dream come true. Jason: Oh, if it's a dream, I don't want to wake up, Maggie. Maggie: What? Jason: Wake up, Maggie. Wake up, Maggie. 
Jason: Wake up, Maggie. Wake up, Maggie. Maggie, wake up. Wake up, Maggie. Maggie: Jas...Jason, you're so young. Jason: Thank you. Maggie: Oh, and Chrissy's still a baby. Jason: Yep. Maggie: Oh, and...oh and I'm young too. Jason: Mmm. What's all this about? Maggie: Oh, Jason, we're gonna be OK. We're good parents, we're not losing it! We get through to our kids; it doesn't always seem like it, but we do. Even your dumb lectures sink in! Honey, it's OK if we get old, I mean its tough, but when we do, we can count on our kids and I love you and I wanna grow old with you. Jason: Dumb lectures! Wait a minute! What are all those cars doing pulling into our drive-way. Mike's got about thirty kids going up to his place. Maggie, I'm gonna put a stop to this. Maggie: Oh, Jason, don't be too tough on him. We're gonna need him to save the day, after we've lost it. Jason: Uh hu.

Stinky: Is it A, Gastropods, B, Marsupials or C, Planaria? Ben: Um...don't help me, here. Stinky: I can't. Ben: Um... It's A, that thing with gas. Stinky: No, it's D, none of the above. Ben: But you didn't even say that! Stinky: I didn't think it was gonna be that. Ben: Ask me another question. Stinky: True or false, Marsupials carry their young in pouches. Ben: Oh, that's gotta be false. I mean, where are these animals gonna buy pouches? And who's gonna sell 'em to 'em? Carol: It's true Ben, it's true, you little rodent! Ben: Carol, you're interrupting! Carol: I can't help it. Ignorance nauseates me! If I haven't mentioned it before, let me mention it now; you're a real disappointment to me. Ben: Did you come in here just to bug me? Carol: Yes. Stinky: Don't let her get you down. My whole family's disappointed in me for hanging out with you. Ben: Ask me another question. Stinky: What's the point? Ben: Just ask me, OK! Stinky: Ben, relax, this test only counts for half our grade. Ben: Stinky, so far the other half of our grade's a D. Stinky: Right, so the worst we can get is a D minus. 
Ben: Oh, we're kidding ourselves. There's no way we're gonna pass this exam. Stinky: Speak for yourself, I haven't got a single question wrong. Ben: That's because you got the book right in front of you. Maggie: Ben, Carol says you need my help. Ben: I do not! Look Mom, the studying is coming along just fine. In fact I was just commenting to Stinky, how much fun learning is. Maggie: Well, I hope so, Ben; because if you bring home another D in Science, you'll see another side of me, you've never seen before. Stinky: Does it have a pouch? Ben: See Mom, we know this stuff so well, we're already telling jokes about it. Stinky just called you a Gasiopod. Carol: Marsupial! Marsupial! Ben: Well at least we know which animal has a blow whole, don't we, Carol? 
Ben: A!

Mike: Oh, come on, don't tell me you haven't suspected it. I mean haven't you heard those strange noises coming from their room at night. I mean and sometimes Dad's not even there! Ben: Yeah. Mike: Snap out of it, Ben. Benny, come on, the only reason they know you do this stuff is because you're a slimy little kid. Ben: It shows, huh? Mike: Benny, look, just because they know every move you're gonna make, there's no reason not to go through with this fool-proof plan of yours. Ben: It isn't?

OK, now all things aside, when you go inside that house, don't panic, be very cool and don't crack. Ben: Right! Right! Mike: Alright, you can do it bro. Ben: Alright, thanks a lot, Mike. Mike: And don't be throw by the fact that they know every thought in your head before you even think it. Ben: Thanks for nothing, Mike. And for your information, I can handle Mom and Dad. I will be completely cool. Jason: How interesting. Ben: Oh, Dad I just meant... 

Ben: I can't cheat, Vito, they're on to me. Vito: Your not thinking. You don't have to get 'em all right. Just make sure you get a couple wrong. Ben: But how do I do that? Vito: Just be yourself.

Keep your arms and legs inside the car and fasten your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride! Ben: (In his head) Which of these four is not a marsupial? A, kangaroo, B, wombat, C, a possum D, your sister. Oh, I'm so confused. Sure, they're happy now, but cheaters never win. Eventually they're gonna get an A. 
Ben: (In his head) Mom, Dad, the first thing that my report card will show you is that I didn't cheat. Na, I can do better than that. You know, I don’t' think my report card is that important in light of the recent events in the Soviet Union. Na, if I mention the Soviet Union, they're gonna bring up my grade in Current Events. OK, now the best thing to do is not to mention my report card at all; just keep it under my hat and try to see which way the wind blows. Yeah, I think I can do that. Mike: Yo, Benny! Ben: Hey, Mike, what are you doing here? Mike: Having lunch with my friends. Ben: Are Mom and Dad around? Mike: Ah...report card day. Ben: How do you know? Mike: Hey Benny, I can smell the fear in the air...smells like defeat. 

Mike: Listen Ben, I gotta run! Ben: You're leaving! Mike: Yeah, well I don't want any of what's coming your way to land on me. 
Maggie: Ben, we don't get upset as long as you do your best, but a D is not your best and you know it. Jason: You're starting high school next year, Ben, it's only gonna get tougher. I hope this two week grounding is gonna impress upon you the fact that you cannot let a class slide all sememster and then suddenly catch up in one night. Maggie: That means, no TV, no hanging out after school with your friends. You are up in your room studying. Ben: Perhaps you over-looked my A in Health. Maggie: That only proves that you can do it if you want to.

Jason: And if you can't pull up that D on your final report card, you're gonna be doing time in summer school. Ben: Um...you know I could've gotten an A. Jason: By cheating Ben! Is that what you're brining up now? Ben: Um...no... Jason: Come on, Ben. You know what happens to cheaters. Ben: Yeah, yeah, they never win. Maggie: Exactly. Ben: Is that rule, they never win or they hardly ever win? Because... Jason: Come on, you're missing the whole point on purpose. Now forget cheating, we're talking about you working up to your potential! Vito: Yo, Benny! Maggie: OK, Ben, we won't embarrass you in front of your little friend. Go tell Vito that your grounding starts right now and that he has to leave. Jason: Damn, what's with that kid? Who does he remind you of? Maggie: Mike. Jason: Exactly. Of course, he turned out alright. Maggie: No he didn't. Ben: Hi guys, look I... 

Ben: Nothing. Go on. Jason: Well, the...advice I gave you last week about cheating Ben, was...wrong. Ben: Sure was. Jason: I'm not saying it was wrong...it was incomplete. Ben: Oh, so it is gonna be one of those talks. Jason: Ben, don't pout like a kid. Come on, I'm trying to talk to you as an adult. Look, when I told you cheaters never win, Ben, I thought that was all you needed to know. But there is a lot more to it, because cheaters do win. Ben: Not only do they win, they win cash. Jason: Sometimes it's even bigger than that. Sometimes they win gold medals at the Olympics; on a rare occasion they even win the White House. Ben: Dad, I'm not following this. I mean, if you can cheat, and get away with it, then what's wrong with it?

Jason: Ben, the way you see cheating really depends on how you see the whole world. Ben: I don't understand it at all. I got a D in Science, remember? Jason: Look...why are we on this earth, Ben? What's the point of our lives. You know, I mean we all have to make a choice, you either see things as order or chaos. And if you see the world as chaos, then there's no point in life at all. You know, nothing matters. We're all just a bunch of people running around we're bumping into each other, having fun, making noises till we die. We're just taking up space, Ben, and I can't believe in that. Well look, if you see...if you see the world as having order, Ben, then there's a reason to everything. There's a reason to get up in the morning, there's a reason to make something of your life; there's a reason for learning, Ben, it all fits together. And if learning is important, Ben, then cheating is wrong. Ben: Even when you get away with it? Jason: What's getting away with it? Ben: Not getting caught. Jason: Which means? Ben: Getting an A. Jason: So does what does the A mean? Ben: Ten Bucks! Jason: So what does it mean you've learned? Ben: Nothing! Jason: Well then you've been cheating for nothing! Ben: Yes! Jason: What's the point in it? Ben: Does there have to be a point? Jason: Yes Ben, or there's chaos!

沪江英语www.hjenglish.com Professor Thorn: So, we have reached that magical time, the last drama project of the year. Now, upon graduation from Landen, many of you will go on to pursue your theatre dreams in Broadway, television, the cinema; or if you're really serious by becoming a waiter. This night of scenes is an important opportunity for all of you to, as we say in show business, suck up. Many of my New York heavy-weight theatre friends will be in attendance, so there's a lot more riding on this evening than just a good grade...possibly a future. (In Mike's imagination) Professor Thorn: What can I say, he acts, he directs, he is theatre...Michael Seaver. Mike: Well I always thought I was kind of good, but I didn't know I was this good. Kate, well what are you doing here dressed like that? Kate: It's your dream, you tell me. Professor Thorn: And so after two weeks, we will show it to you... Kate: Mike, stop smiling. Mike: Oh, sorry, right, I was day dreaming about what could happen...and what you'd be wearing when it did. (Jason and Maggie are playing basketball) Maggie: Alright...ooh...and in! And she scores again. It's not even a contest! Jason: Yep, yep, yep. All in energy in the world out here, and when we get upstairs...zippo. Maggie: Pardon me? Jason: Nothing sweetheart. Maggie: Oh, what was that score? I forgot. Jason: The score...what's the point... The point is for us to get a little exercise, isn't it? Maggie: Uh hu, that's why you are losing. Thirteen months younger and he folds like a tent. Kate: You cheated! Mike: I did not. Kate: Let me see the coin. Mike: Hey, look, I won the toss fair and square... Jason: Remember what you and I used to flip coins over? Maggie: Oh, do I! You always called pence. Jason: I still do. Mike: Look Kate, you're just being a sore loser. Kate: Oh, yeah!Mike: Fair is fair, Kate! Kate: Fair is fair, Kate! Fair is fair, Kate! Jason: Mike, Mike, you don't even try to explain when they're in a mood like that. Maggie: They!

Jason: Not you honey. I'm talking about young women. No, I meant women without... Maggie: Do you really wanna finish this sentence? Jason: Na.Maggie: OK, what's the deal, Mike? Mike: Oh, don't worry guys. It was just a professional disagreement. I mean, see, Kate and I are both directing scenes for drama class, and we both want the same actress. Jason: Oh, Kate's jealous, huh? Mike: No Dad, I told you, this is professional. Don't you know anything about modern women? Jason: Well... Maggie: No he doesn't. What's so special about this actress? Mike: Well, see, she's done sit-coms, and she's done real plays. Oh and Dad, OK, you know that commercial, with the girl and chimpanzee and they shave her legs? Jason: Yes. Mike: Yes. She takes classes at Landen. Jason: The chimp or the actress? 
Mike: No.Courtney: Well, it doesn't matter. I'm sorry Mike, but good luck with your play anyway. 

Mike: Oh, thanks.Courtney: You're doing a scene from Night of the Iguana? You're doing Tennessee Williams! Mike: Well yeah... Courtney: I have been dying to do something by Williams! Mike: Oh, great, well then do it. Courtney: But what do I tell Kate? Mike: Tell Kate, she's a dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing.... It doesn't matter if she's got great eyes, beautiful hair and a killer body. 
Mike: Morning everybody and welcome to Night of the...Iguana. OK, before we start, I just wanna say a couple of things. First, thank you all for coming, especially you Courtney. Courtney: Oh, Mike, come on. Mike: Everyone have a seat and we'll read through the scene, OK? (In Mike's head) With lights

down we can hear the surf. It's a quiet evening in Mexico, but passions run deep. Oh, she is so bad. Man, is she bad? And she's done sit-coms! Well I be none of the ones on ABC. Courtney: Mike! Mike! That's the end of the scene. Do you wanna run it again from the top? Mike: Err...No. (In his head) One more word and I'll shoot myself. (Spoken) I think everyone's worked pretty hard for the first day, so I'll see everybody tomorrow. Courtney: Do you have any notes you want me to think about for tomorrow. Mike: (In his head) Yeah, don't come back. (Spoken) No, no, no, I think it's going pretty good. Courtney: 'Cause if you have concerns, don't hesitate to speak up. Mike: (In his head) You stink, like a dead mackerel. (Spoken) No, I got nothing to say. Courtney: OK, see you tomorrow. Mike: OK, bye bye. (In his head) I wonder if that chimp is available. Kate: Oh, excuse me. Courtney: Oh, Kate, listen, I hope Mike explained to you how bad I felt about not doing your scene. 
Mike: (In his head) Yes! Yes! She's stinking up the joint. She's history, she'll realise and quit. 


She's related to all those people, that's the only explanation. Kate: I suppose I should blame myself for trusting a guy with a two-headed coin. Mike: What are you talking about? Kate: Oh, Kate, she's terrible. She played Night of the Iguana, and the iguana won. Mike: What, you thought she was good? Kate: Yes.Mike: This has got to be a dream. Wait a minute, this can't be a dream, you've got all your clothes on. Kate: If what that girl did out there tonight is your idea of terrible, you have no place anywhere near a stage. Courtney: Oh, Mike, they loved it! Congratulations! Mike: Um...you had doubts?Maggie: Oh, Mike, you can act, you can direct, you can do it all!

Jason: Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's my boy!Ben: Wow! Mike: Hey, don't tell me you liked Courtney too. Ben: My butt didn't go numb once! Mike: OK, so, Mom, Dad, you can tell me; don't you think I had one major problem out there? Jason: I don't know. All I could see was Courtney! Maggie: Excuse us honey, we wanna go congratulate her too. Mike: (In his head) Maybe I have no business near a stage. Carol: Mike, it was wonderful! Brilliant. Mike: Carol, why don't you just shoot me? Carol: I mean it, I loved it, especially Courtney.Mike: Look, if you don't have anything nasty to say, don't say anything at all. Carol: What do you want me to say? 

Carol: Err...(sniffing)...Yes. Mike: As an actor...as an actor, Carol. Come on, I don't even know if I'm good anymore, I don't even know what's good. I mean how does anybody know? Carol: You just know. For instance, when it comes to intellect...well... Mike: So, how do you know, you're well... Carol: Very simple. I got straight A's. Mike: Oh, come on, Carol, what the heck do those grades mean now? Carol: Well... Mike: Come on Carol, they mean absolutely didley in the real world; you know that. Carol: Well I'm head of punctuation in a prominent publishing house! Mike: Ooh, saving a lot of lives there, aren't you? Forget about the stupid grades and the pointless job. I mean, do you have any real proof that you're good? Carol: No.

Mike: Wait. Come on, Carol, help me. Carol: I can't help anybody, I'm useless. Maggie: Carol, don't eat in your room. Carol: Don't worry, it will be gone before I get there. Maggie: Mike, what's going on? Mike: Oh, nothing, I just asked Carol, how do you know if you're good. Jason: What's this about, Mike? Mike: Well, OK, see it's just seeing everyone going ape chips over Courtney... Maggie: Oh, she was wonderful. Now that is what acting is all about. 

Mike: Dad, people who are a little off tell you you're good, and you believe them? Jason: Mike... Mike: Dad, think, what if who...who tell you that they're cured are just cutting you loose so they can find a good psychiatrist? Jason: I am a good psychiatrist. Mike: Dad...Dad come on, I mean, maybe the people who keep coming back, you're not helping and the one's who tell you they're cured are really trying to find somebody who can. Jason: Just because I lose two patients to Doctor Harry the hot tub Strickland, does not mean... Mike: Dad, I didn't mean to upset you. Jason: Oh, OK, alright, I can tell you this, Mike; that only somebody who has ever asked himself that question has any chance of answering it. Mike: Yeah. I just wish there was a way for a person to tell if he was really good.

Can I ask you something? Professor Thorn: What? Mike: How do you know if you're good? Professor Thorn: How do I know I'm good, how do you know you're good or how does one know one's good? Mike: The last thing you said. Professor Thorn: Ah, one of life's essential questions. Mike: Ah, you sound just like my dad. Professor Thorn: Your father's British! 
Professor Thorn: I'm being serious Mr. Seaver. 


Mike: Well then, how do I know who to listen to? Professor Thorn: Years ago, I had a small part in a Joseph Pap production of Twelfth Night. Afterwards my dear sweet mother gushed all over me and told me I was wonderful... Mike: And you believed it! Professor Thorn: Certainly not. Daffy old bat. But I digress. Anyway, Mr. Pap himself spoke to me after a matinee. Now he didn't have to speak to me, but he chose to. He said, young man, you have promise. Now that Mr. Seaver I believed. Mike: Professor Thorn. Professor Thorn: Yes. Mike: Am I any good at this? Professor Thorn: Well Mr. Seaver, I'll say this...you have promise. Mike: Yeah! Professor Thorn: Yeah.

Mike: Well I'll say this...you have promise. Professor Thorn: Thank you Mr. Seaver. All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts.

Jason: I know. Maggie: Honey, can’t it wait? This is my favorite re run of Cagney and Lacey TV: Spread em clown! Jason: Never mind. Ben: What did you hit me for? Maggie: Sounds like your son is in trouble again. Jason: Lets get him in here and watch Cagney and Lacey. Jason: What the heck is going on out here? Maggie: And why is there sand all over the driveway? And its forty degrees out. What are you girls doing in bathing suits? Girl: because we were stupid enough to believe that Ben was a serious filmmaker, like Sylvester Stallone. Girls: Yeah! Maggie: Ben, what do you have to say for yourself? Ben: Yo. Girl: Let’s go ladies. Jason: Talk now. Ben: well, see, I was just finishing my movie for English class, when Laura-Lynn got the crazy idea that I was just doing the movie so I could um,.. Girl: So you could grope me. Ben: If you are going to leave. Leave. Women can be so nuts. Maggie: Wrong parent Ben. Ben: Women can be so nuts. Jason: Wrong drive way Ben. Maggie: Ben, I thought you were going to do a documentary about me. A working mother trying to balance career and home. Ben: Face it mum. No one's interested in that. Maggie: So you passed up something worthwhile like that to do girls in bathing suits. Hu, Jason can you believe this? Jason: Your mothers got a point Ben. There's nothing wrong with doing a boring movie. Jason: well Ben, we better see this little movie right now. Ben: There's a lot of stuff on that tape I haven’t edited out yet. Maggie: Yeah, I bet there is. Carol: What are you guys watching? Maggie: Ben’s movie for English class.

Ben: Jim. Mike: Yes Jim. Jim, my haven’t you grown since the last twelve years when we bought that alligator and flushed him down the toilet and haven’t thought of since. Carol: Don’t you think we should check his report card before we sign it? Mike: Why? Little Tim has turned out just fine. Ben: Jim! Jim! Mike: We named you, we can change it. Well son, to show you that I have no hard feelings about these selfish outbursts, I’m going to reward you for all these fine C's. Here's a, here's a couple for, uh, for six cents off tidy flesh, which you can use to clean the toilet bowl where we flushed the alligator twelve years ago and haven’t thought of since.

Stinky: don’t be a fool. Stay in school. Drop outs just take their future and drop it down the toilet. Much like that one eyed alligator. Ben: Oh, oh great! Stinky: Don’t be a fool. Stay in school. Drop outs just take their future and drop, drop it...Don’t be a fool. Stay in school. Drop outs just take their future and flush it down the toilet. Much like that one eyed alligator your parents bought for you twelve years ago and never thought of since. Ben: Thanks stinky. I'm glad we had this little talk. I'm going to stay in school. Stinky: Speaking of dizzy, do you want to talk about blondes first, or red heads? Ben: I don’t care who we think about. I just got to get my mind of the beautiful Bambie. Just stick to the script. Stinky: I'm sure some day Jim, you'll do something to make her notice you. Something big. Something great. Til then, you can dream. I have to go to the can. Ahhh! Urgh!!!

Bambie: If you save my life, I’ll show you my appreciation. I didn’t know he could fight like that. He's such a man. I feel like such a fool for ignoring him all these years, like his parents do.

beyond the call of duty. Ben: Thank you very much Mr. President. Maggie (Playing Barbara Bush): May I say something young man? Ben: You see Mrs. Bush, you don’t actually have any lines here.
